{% raw %}The 21A Collection is here and this Grey is LITERALLY PERFECT! I couldn‚Äôt be more in love. <br /><br />Since we just got some in stock I wanted to make a comparison with some other grey bags to help you better see the true color. <br /><br />If you love greys/neutrals - this is the kind of bag that you do not want to pass up!‚ú®<br /><br />What are your thoughts? Are you in love or not really? How does this shade of grey compare to the others in your opinion?<br /><br />Subscribe for more bag reviews, size comparisons, unboxing and MORE [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1me-yL03iW2_Qf8NEqB0w]">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1me-yL03iW2_Qf8NEqB0w]</a><br /><br />See all that's available:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://redeluxe.com/shop">https://redeluxe.com/shop</a><br /><br />Check Out Authentic Beautiful Jewelry  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://secondlifejewels.ca">https://secondlifejewels.ca</a><br /><br />Watch next ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb68SoYI35I&amp;list=PL4cAM241Z-KHO17-TGA8-4k4SoN9pmzJ5">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb68SoYI35I&amp;list=PL4cAM241Z-KHO17-TGA8-4k4SoN9pmzJ5</a><br /><br />Let‚Äôs connect:<br /><br />Instagram ‚Äì @redeluxe<br /><br />Facebook - @myredeluxe<br /><br />Website - redeluxe.com<br /><br />*** IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK BELOW***<br /><br />Thanks so much for watching and supporting!
