{% raw %}Object-Oriented Programming has been the dominant approach for the past couple of decades, but Functional programming languages are growing in popularity and influence. So is OO programming outdated? Is Functional programming a fashion that simply misses the point?<br /><br />Many Functional programmes think that Object Oriented programming is bad. Many OO programmers think that Functional Programming is not scalable, what is the truth?<br /><br />In this episode, Dave Farley explores the software engineering question of object-oriented vs functional programming. Where did these ideas come from, what do they mean and why do they matter. Also, are there other ideas that may be coming in future?<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />üéì CD TRAINING COURSES üéì<br />If you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DFTraining">https://bit.ly/DFTraining</a><br /><br />'GET GOING WITH CONTINUOUS DELIVERY PIPELINES' COURSE<br />A great way to truly learn the fundamental ideas of Continuous Delivery &amp; DevOps for just ¬£99!
