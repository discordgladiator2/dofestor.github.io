{% raw %}‚ñ† TANZANIA, TANGANYIKA: Life out in the bush in Tanzania can be dangerous. But it's not just the wildlife you need to pay close attention to. Little cuts and scrapes from thorns and branches you step on can seriously mess up your foot. It's also super painful. I stepped on such a thorn on Zanzibar and it went straight though my thick running nike shoe (the heel to be precise) and deep into my foot.<br /><br />The local Masai tribes however have come up with a solution for this: make shoes from old car tyres. These shoes are not only super durable. They last for decades according to the people I've spoken to who've grown up wearing them. But they're also super strong and nothing that's grows out in the bush will be able to pierce through your car tyre shoes.<br /><br />In the Masaai tribe I lived in they've come up with a slight adaption of these ubiquitous car tyre shoes and added an antenna for %g reception to the front of it. So how are these shoes made? How long does it take? And what does the finished pair of shoes look like?<br /><br />After the lesson in How to make a shoe from a car tyre there are some deleted scenes from the goat BBQ video and scenes from around the Boma with Don Jr, Mango and others.<br /><br />‚ñ† THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED TO EMI'S FUNDRAISER.
