{% raw %}One more video  before I call it a day. In this video, we simply setup the necessary models to create the most basic / atomic transaction record in the accounting system -- the T-Account. To do so, we have 2 new models:<br /><br />- AccountingEntry (the model representing a single T-Account transaction)<br />- JournalEntry (with references to the accounting entry and accounting code)<br /><br />Getting a bit sleepy so just laying the groundwork for the actual T-Account or Accounting Entries module.{% endraw %}
