Bars, clubs and venues opened and masks were not mandatory. The only exception was the number of people accepted in a given area. We were therefore really hopeful and looking forward to our release party, which was supposed to take place on March 13th of the same year, but was cancelled on the same day due to newly instated COVID restrictions by the Swiss government. The closer we were getting to the actual release party date, the more dubious we were getting on the feasibility of the event, given that experts were fearing a second wave hitting Switzerland. Against all odds, and lucky for us this time, the Autumn restrictions were instated the week following our release party. It almost felt like our concert stopped time and for one evening in 6 months, the only emotions that were going through our bodies was pure happiness. We cannot wait to be back on stage, after all this time. Times have never been so uncertain for us and we believe that the end of the tunnel is in sight. Stay safe. <br /><br />If you wish to support the band, Bandcamp is waiving its revenue this coming Friday (March 5th) meaning that a 100% of the money you will put purchasing an item of our merchandise will get directly to us.
