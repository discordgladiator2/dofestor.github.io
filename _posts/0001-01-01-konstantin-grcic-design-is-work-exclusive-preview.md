His clients list reads like a who’s who of international brands: Vitra, Magis, Iittalla, Krups, Lamy, Muji, Hugo Boss, Rado, Audi, among others. He is considered one of the most innovative and profound contemporary designers and thinkers worldwide. Many of his designs are already<br />in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris), such as his design icon »Chair_One«, or his lamp »Mayday«, a portable floor or suspended lamp made of plastic, reminiscent of the illumination devices found in an auto repair shop.<br />Grcic argues at a certain remove from such terms as aesthetics of form, or comfort, using such expressions as narration, context, surrounding space. His focus is on human beings and their environment; the things with which they surround themselves, and that surround them. &quot;Konstantin Grcic - Design is Work&quot; provides clear insight into the world of design, as it guides the audience toward a more aware handling of the objects surrounding them.<br /><br />Subscribe to wocomoCULTURE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/VITuUt">https://goo.gl/VITuUt</a> <br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/wocomo">https://www.facebook.com/wocomo</a>{% endraw %}
