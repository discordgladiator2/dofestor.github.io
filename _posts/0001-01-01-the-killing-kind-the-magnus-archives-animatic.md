{% raw %}content warnings: spoilers for all of TMA, canon-typical levels of violence and gore, body horror, eyestrain, excessive amounts of eyes<br /><br />me? make another animatic to one of Marianas Trench’s seven-minute medleys? it’s more likely than you think!<br /><br />jokes aside, I wanted to make one last love letter to The Magnus Archives. it is a very, very special media that struck me with its passion, nuance, and sincerity, and I’m not sure how well I can really word just how much it means to me. while I was only around for the tail end of it, getting to engage with it and the fandom as it ended was not an experience I will be forgetting anytime soon. <br /><br />something like TMA doesn’t come around often. I’m honored to have been there for the end.<br /><br />thank you all, and enjoy!<br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />Song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOXgKgZTs3I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOXgKgZTs3I</a><br /><br />I don't own the music, the characters, or the story; just the animation and art.{% endraw %}
