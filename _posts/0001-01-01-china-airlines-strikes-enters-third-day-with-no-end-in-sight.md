{% raw %}A strike by pilots at Taiwan''s flagship carrier China Airlines has dragged into its third day. So far the strike has resulted in 52 canceled flights and affected more than 10,000 passengers. Another 28 flights are expected to be canceled tomorrow. The Transportation Ministry said today that the carrier must shoulder its responsibilities and properly compensate travel agencies and travelers for their losses.Labor and management met yesterday for the first time since the strike began Friday. The carrier agreed to the union''s request to assign four pilots to any flight longer than 12 hours. But the two sides clashed on the number of crew for shorter flights. The union insisted on three pilots for flights exceeding seven hours, while the carrier would only grant three for flights exceeding eight hours.Li Hsin-yenPilots Union TaoyuanWe keep hoping that the company will rethink the issue of pilots'' fatigue. But they''re not budging, and that''s where we are stuck.
