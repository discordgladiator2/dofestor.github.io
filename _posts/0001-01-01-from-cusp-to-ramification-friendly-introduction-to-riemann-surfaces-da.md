{% raw %}If you look at the image of the circle |z - 1| = 1 under the map f(z) = cos(z), you'll notice that it has a hugely unpleasant &quot;cusp&quot; at 1. If it's your first time noticing something like this, you should be annoyed: I took a smooth curve, passed it though a smooth function, yet ended up getting a singular curve? With a little bit of thinking, one can see that this is a consequence of the fact that f' vanishes at z = 0. But we are not satisfied, since there are more questions to be asked: Can I classify such phenomena? How does these kind of singularities behave in general? Is there any deep geometry behind all these?<br /><br />We'll start with some motivating examples as to why we study Riemann surfaces. Then, we'll give a brief overview of the general theory about them, before getting to deeper results like the Riemann-Hurwitz theorem.<br /><br />A significant proportion of the talk should be accessible to all students. Any knowledge in complex analysis will help with motivation and understanding.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdswONpWjfKTbpkBUP4fOyA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdswONpWjfKTbpkBUP4fOyA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archim.soc.srcf.net/">https://archim.soc.srcf.net/</a><br />Our Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/archimedeans/">https://www.facebook.com/archimedeans/</a><br />Join our mailing list: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/soc-archimedeans">https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/soc-archimedeans</a>{% endraw %}
