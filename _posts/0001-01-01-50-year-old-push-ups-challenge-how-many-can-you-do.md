{% raw %}Guys...today I want to push you to challenge yourself. I want you to do this push up challenge to see how many you can do. So, let’s get started with this video tutorial with the 50 year old push ups challenge.<br /><br />The first thing you need to do is JUST START. Building a stronger chest in the gym, doesn’t mean you are going to be able to do more push ups. The key to doing more push ups is to do them often. Doing push ups uses your own body weight, which means for you guys that are overweight, you are at a disadvantage. <br /><br />The next thing you need to do is PICK YOUR PUSH UP STYLE. If you can’t do 5 or 6 quality form push ups then I recommend doing some different style push ups to build yourself up. <br /><br />The first variation of push ups you can do is KNEE PUSH UPS. You can also do ELEVATED PUSH UPS. These are more difficult than knee push ups, but still easier than the standard push up. The more elevated you are with your head above your toes, the easier the push ups will be. <br /><br />When you are able to do those variation push ups then you can move to the standard style push ups. The next thing that is important is your HAND AND ELBOW POSITIONING. You want to make sure your hands are shoulder width apart. Your hands need to be straight, don’t have them pointing outward or inward. You want your elbows to be at a 45 degree angle from your body, you don’t want them to be too close to your body or flared out to the side. <br /><br />Now, something you should do before you start doing the push ups is WARM-UP. You need to warm up your muscles that work together to help you do push ups. <br /><br />Once you are all warmed up, you are going to get down and do as many push ups as you can without fail. I was able to do 35 today. When you see how many you can do, set a goal for how many you want to be able to do. Find out what your max set is, that way you can find how many reps you should do in a set. You don’t want to do your max reps each set. If you can do 30 reps then your sets should be around 20 reps to build your max rep range. <br /><br />Do 4-6 sets, 3 times a week. Comment on this video to let us know how many you can do, and what your goal is. Stick with this and never give up on yourself.<br /><br />Make sure to subscribe to our channel for more videos on how to build you chest and get in shape: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/liveanabolic?sub_confirmation=1">https://youtube.com/liveanabolic?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
