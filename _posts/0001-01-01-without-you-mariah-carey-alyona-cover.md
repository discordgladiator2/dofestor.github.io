The power ballad has been recorded by over 180 artists, and versions released as singles by Harry Nilsson (1971) and Mariah Carey (1994) became international best-sellers. Paul McCartney once described the ballad as &quot;the killer song of all time&quot;.<br /><br />In 1972, writers Ham and Evans received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.<br /><br />üôãüèº ABOUT ME: My name is Alyona Yarushina, or Aly. I was born in Russia, and I am a singer, a musician, <br />I play the piano and do many arrangements myself, I‚Äôm in love with 80s and 90s rock. In Russia, I played with several bands. One of them is the best Led Zeppelin tribute band in Russia called &quot;Plumbum Dreams&quot;.  The other one is called &quot;Back from the USSR&quot;, where we played Beatles songs in my own arrangements. We played in Liverpool, England almost every year on the Beatles week fest.  My dad, Valeriy Yarushin is my bass player in this band. He's a legend of Russian folk-rock and his band ‚ÄúAriel‚Äù was most popular in the 70s and still is now.  I learned a lot from him.<br />In 2004, I won the ‚ÄúInternational Hopes of Europe‚Äù competition in Sochi, Russia along with the ‚ÄúGrand Prix‚Äù prize for singing I Have Nothing by Whitney Houston.<br /><br /><br />TAGS: Alyona Yarushina, Alyona cover, –ê–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –Ø—Ä—É—à–∏–Ω–∞, Mariah Carey, Without You - Mariah Carey (Alyona cover), Pete Ham and Tom Evans of British rock group Badfinger, power ballad, 90s ballad, 70s ballad, Mariah Carey cover, Butterfly, Vision of love, all i want for christmas is you, we belong together, when you believe, hero, always be my baby, one sweet day, My all, obsessed, I wanna know what love is, fantasy, oh holy night, vision of love, never too far away{% endraw %}
