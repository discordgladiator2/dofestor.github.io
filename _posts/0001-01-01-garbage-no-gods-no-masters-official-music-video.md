{% raw %}Watch the official music video of the title track from Garbage's the album ‘No Gods No Masters’, out now.<br /><br />“I tried to make sense of the world, I was trying to make sense of left and right, literally. Like why do some people vote right? Why do some people vote left? And all of that comes from a concern for ourselves, for our friends, for our families, ultimately, for our babies. I was really inspired by going to Chile. I went to Santiago during the protests there, which were profoundly moving. We were driving down the street, and the whole city was covered in graffiti, like all the old museums and palaces. And I was shocked. The beautiful people that I was with said, ‘But why are you so shocked? We’re protesting human lives and you're more shocked that property and buildings and monuments have been hurt here. And, in fact, human beings are being hurt, and this is what you must focus on.’ That was like a slap in the face.” Manson tied that awakening to the confederate statues being toppled in the U.S. and how the hand-wringing overshadowed the real struggles of the marginalized in society. “All these people, they have more value than a monument to slave traders, but they don't have more value in the consciousness of society, and I think it's devilish and obscene, and I want power to be dismantled, and a society re-imagined. So, this song is about re-imagining our society for the future, for our children and not making the same mistakes over and over again and allowing greed to corrupt our thinking.”<br /><br />Make sure to subscribe to Garbage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Garbage.lnk.to/YouTubeID">https://Garbage.lnk.to/YouTubeID</a> and hit the bell to get notified of all new uploads<br /><br />Listen to our new song “No Gods No Masters” now and download the album ‘No Gods No Masters’: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Garbage.lnk.to/NoGodsNoMastersID">https://Garbage.lnk.to/NoGodsNoMastersID</a><br /><br />Follow Garbage<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.garbage.com">https://www.garbage.com</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Garbage.lnk.to/InstagramID">https://Garbage.lnk.to/InstagramID</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Garbage.lnk.to/TwitterID">https://Garbage.lnk.to/TwitterID</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Garbage.lnk.to/FacebookID">https://Garbage.lnk.to/FacebookID</a> <br /><br />More music from Garbage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Garbage.lnk.to/listenID">https://Garbage.lnk.to/listenID</a><br /><br />Director: Scott Stuckey<br />Producer: Laura Burhenn<br />Production Company: Our Secret Handshake<br />Editor/Colorist: Andy Deluca<br />Styling: Candice Lambert<br />Hair: Clyde Haygood<br />Makeup: Torsten Witte<br />DP: Stefan Mentil<br />Production Design: Greenhouse Creative<br />1st AC: Chris McMillan<br />Gaffer: Chris Patterson<br />Key Grip: Mario Sandoval<br />Dolly/Swing Grip: Jason Zuidema<br />PAs: Kurtis Mayo &amp; Kelli Mayo<br /><br />Lyrics<br />Be kind<br />Beware<br />Be good<br />Don’t be scared<br />Nothing lasts and no one stays<br />The same forever so accept the change<br /><br />Where the wind blows<br />Round and round in circles<br /><br />The future is mine just the same<br />No master or gods to obey<br />I’ll make all the same mistakes<br />Over and over again<br />Over and over again<br /><br />Save your prayers for yourself <br />’Cause they don’t work and they don’t help<br />The things we do the things we don’t<br />The things we love the things we lost<br /><br />You want what’s mine<br />I want what’s yours<br />I want what’s mine that once was yours<br /><br />Where the wind blows<br />Round and round in circles<br />Where the wind blows <br />Round and round in circles<br /><br />The future is mine just the same<br />No master or gods to obey<br />I’ll make all the same mistakes<br />Over and over again<br /><br />All our friends<br />All our lovers<br />All our babies<br /><br />You want what’s mine<br />I want what’s yours<br />I want what’s mine that once was yours<br /><br />#Garbage #NoGodsNoMasters #MusicVideo{% endraw %}
