{% raw %}I had to be careful that this epidermoid cyst didn't get in my patient's mouth, don't want him eating cyst!!üò±  <br /><br />An epidermoid cyst is a non-cancerous growth commonly found on the skin of the face or neck, but can occur anywhere on the body. Just as its name suggests, these cysts occur as a result of epidermal cells, cells from the top layer of your skin a.k.a the epidermis, overgrow in a confined space. The buildup of these cells under the skin results in a ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù consistency and often a pungent odor! Epidermoid cysts are typically harmless and have no symptoms, but people often seek removal due to the appearance of the bump or because the cyst has become inflamed or ruptured. If you have a ruptured cyst you may notice, sudden redness, pain, swelling, and heat around the area, all of which can lead to an abscess forming. Surgically removing the cyst can cure the area, but the entire cyst sac and all of its contents need to be removed to ensure the cyst won‚Äôt grow back!<br /><br />SHOP<br />- SLMD Skincare to learn more about my skincare line: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://slmdskincare.com/">https://slmdskincare.com/</a> <br />- Official Dr. Pimple Popper Shop for Comedone Extractors and Tweezers: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shop.drpimplepopper.com">http://www.shop.drpimplepopper.com</a> <br /><br />__<br /><br />FOLLOW me on Social Media: <br />Instagram: <br />- for 24/7 pops (@drpimplepopper): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3smTOED">https://bit.ly/3smTOED</a> <br />- for my work, my life, my pops (@drsandralee): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LscBO8">https://bit.ly/2LscBO8</a> <br />- for skincare tips and info on my skincare line (@slmdskincare): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3oHr1IM">https://bit.ly/3oHr1IM</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3oU3Rz7">https://bit.ly/3oU3Rz7</a> <br />Twitter (@drsandraleemd): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9">https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9</a> <br />TikTok (@drpimplepopper): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9">https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9</a> <br />__<br />DOWNLOAD the Dr. Pimple Popper All Access App:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dr-pimple-popper/id1483066405">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dr-pimple-popper/id1483066405</a> <br />Start Your FREE TRIAL TODAY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://allaccess.drpimplepopper.com/">https://allaccess.drpimplepopper.com/</a> <br /><br />You can watch my TV appearances here: <br />@Dr. Sandra Lee (aka Dr. Pimple Popper) - TV Appearances <br /><br />My BOOK, Put Your Best Face Forward, is on sale NOW at Barnes and Noble, Amazon, Audible, and Kindle.
