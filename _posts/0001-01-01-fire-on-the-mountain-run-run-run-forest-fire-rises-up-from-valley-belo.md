{% raw %}A forest fire lit by a careless villager or tourist rises up from the valley below, carried by strong winds,  and climbs to Mussoorie where it lights up many hills and destroys hundreds of acres of Himalayan forests.<br /><br />Climate change has truly started to bite. Large swathes of pristine Himalayan forests were destroyed in the spring of 2021, due to inordinate dryness, lack of rain and humidity, and the carelessness of tourists and villages wherein someone threw a lit match, cigarette or bidi, and did enormous damage.<br /><br />Forest fires have been ravaging the hills of the lower Himalaya, and birds' nests with eggs and chicks have been burned to nothingness, huge trees destroyed, the habitat of insects and reptiles destroyed in seconds, and even larger mammals like Barking Deer have had their feet burned due to the fast rampaging fires.<br /><br />The forest department and fire departments had their hands tied as personnel were short, they had access to little water resources, few vehicles, and no fire fighting equipment worth the name. Meanwhile, the Himalaya burned...<br /><br />wildfilmsindia crews can be seen trying to control the fires, with limited water resources, to little or no avail.<br /><br />This footage is part of the broadcast stock footage archive of Wilderness Films India Ltd., the largest HD and 4K collection from South Asia.
