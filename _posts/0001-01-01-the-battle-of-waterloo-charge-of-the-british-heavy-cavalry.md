{% raw %}&quot;At this crucial juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry, formed unseen behind the ridge, to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry.<br /><br /><br /><br />Continuing their attack, the squadrons on the left of the Household Brigade then destroyed Aulard's brigade. Despite attempts to recall them, however, they continued past La Haye Sainte and found themselves at the bottom of the hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade formed in squares.<br /><br /><br /><br />Napoleon promptly responded by ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two lancer regiments in the I Corps light cavalry division. The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />From the movie Waterloo.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066549/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066549/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo#Charge_of_the_British_heavy_cavalry">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo#Charge_of_the_British_heavy_cavalry</a>{% endraw %}
