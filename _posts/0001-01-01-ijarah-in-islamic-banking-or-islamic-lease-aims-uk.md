Under the concept of Ijarah in Islamic finance, a customer can use an asset or equipment, which is owned by an Islamic bank, for a fixed period against a fixed price. Al Ijara or Islamic lease is very similar to a leasing contract, and the asset under the Ijarah contract could be a car, home, plant, or a machinery. <br /><br />AIMS' Institute of Islamic Banking and Finance:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aims.education/islamic-banking-and-finance-institute/">https://aims.education/islamic-banking-and-finance-institute/</a><br /><br />Get Social:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/aimseducationonline">https://www.facebook.com/aimseducationonline</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EducationAIMS">https://twitter.com/EducationAIMS</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AIMSEducationUK">https://www.youtube.com/c/AIMSEducationUK</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/aimseducationonline">https://www.linkedin.com/company/aimseducationonline</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/educationaims/">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/educationaims/</a>{% endraw %}
