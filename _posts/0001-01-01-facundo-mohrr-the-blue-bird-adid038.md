{% raw %}Get it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/ADID038">http://smarturl.it/ADID038</a><br /><br />Facundo has been at every party this summer without actually leaving his home of Buenos Aires.  His music sound tracking blissful moments with eyes closed. Broad smiles. Hands up. <br />Hips wiggling. For his first single release on the label there’s a beautiful range of energies and feeling. Each track a gentle giant. On laptop speakers you might not feel the tension or impact these tracks have, time and time again, delivered. Hypnotic. Dreamy. <br />Perfect examples of our sound.<br /><br />Facundo Mohrr’s star, no, cloud, is on the rise.<br /> <br />Love, Leee.   <br /><br />A1. Facundo Mohrr - La Espere <br />A2. Facundo Mohrr - The Blue Bird<br />B1. Facundo Mohrr  - What Else Is There<br />B2. Facundo Mohrr, Valdovinos - The Reverse Loop Of Love{% endraw %}
