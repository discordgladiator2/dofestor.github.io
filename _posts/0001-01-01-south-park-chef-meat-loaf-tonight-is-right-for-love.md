{% raw %}Album - Chef Aid: The South park Album<br /><br />Track # 18<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />(Chef)Tonight is right for love, you know I<br />Wanna touch you where the lights don't go<br />Tonight is right for love (with Meredith Baxter-Birney)<br /><br />Expressing love so sweet,<br />I'll keep you burning like a dog in heat<br />Tonight is right for love (with Meredith Baxter-Birney)<br /><br />We had a love that was so magical<br />With Meredith Baxter-Birney burning, burning in my soul<br />I'm not talking about Meredith Baxter-Birney today, no<br />I'm talking about Meredith Baxter-Birney that was on Family Ties two years ago<br /><br />(Meat Loaf)After the love comes a darkness in hell, <br />A demon inside you like a bottomless well<br />Nothing is safe and everything is a lie<br />Love doesn't last, no matter how hard you try<br />Burnin', burnin', through your brain<br />Unthinkable pain...<br /><br />(Chef) Meat<br /><br />(Meat Loaf) But when you finally realize that it's all in vein<br /><br />(Chef) Meat Loaf<br /><br />(Meat Loaf) Splinters of wood, they can be forced through your eyes<br /><br />(Chef) Meat Loaf!!!<br /><br />(Meat Loaf)Cheese graters of steel being rubbed in your thighs<br />Your skin is comin' off and you railin' in salt!<br /><br />(Chef) Meat!!! Hey Meat! Meat Loaf!!!<br /><br />(Meat Loaf) What? <br /><br />(Chef) Where are you goin' son?<br /><br />(Meat Loaf) Oh... gosh...<br /><br />(Chef) Come back to us, we're over here<br /><br />(Meat Loaf) OK, oh, sorry Chef, man. Sorry. <br /><br />(Chef) It's alright son, but this song is about Meredith Baxter-Birney,<br />not about splinters of wood in your eyes, you need to calm down man.<br /><br />(Meat Loaf) You're right<br /><br />(Chef) Here, have a taco <br /><br />(Meat Loaf) Taco, great, I need a taco<br /><br />(Chef) You're messing up my business with Meredith Baxter-Birney. OK? <br /><br />(Meat Loaf) Yeah, great<br /><br />(Chef &amp; Meat Loaf) Tonight is right for love<br />The rain is fallen and Jay Leno is on<br />Let's turn down the lights, turn up the volume<br />And go crazy<br />I'll touch your body and soul<br />And change the channels with remote control<br />'Cause tonight is right for love with Meredith Baxter-Birney{% endraw %}
