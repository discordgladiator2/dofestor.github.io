His first job was at a small liquor store, where he earned 20 cents an hour. After that, he worked as a packer in a supermarket. His plan of <br />becoming an animator failed when he started abusing marijuana and alcohol on a <br />regular basis.  <br /><br />At the age of 19, two of his closest friends began learning the guitar. Reinhardt <br />immediately fell in love with it. With no formal training, the three friends simply <br />taught themselves how to play. A year later, Reinhardt was inspired by a Flamenco <br />guitar player, and began learning Flamenco Rumba Guitar from YouTube videos. <br />One day, he was sitting at a small roadside steak restaurant with his parents, and <br />there was a man playing solo guitar covers. Reinhardt approached him to make <br />small talk and the owner of the restaurant overheard that Reinhardt played a bit of <br />Spanish Guitar music.  <br /><br />So the owner asked Reinhardt “Why don’t you come back next week to play, and I <br />will give you a steak and 10 dollars in return?” So Reinhardt Buhr played his first <br />solo Spanish guitar gig that following weekend and hasn’t stopped since. <br />Reinhardt Buhr quickly became known around South Africa and formed a duo <br />band called “Wild Lettuce”. He and the drummer performed many national <br />tours. They also opened for a lot of great artists. But unfortunately, Reinhardt fell <br />into a dark habit of abusing alcohol, drugs, and cocaine. <br /><br />This affected him, his career, and everyone around him in a very negative way.  <br />The band broke up. Reinhardt Buhr went solo and left his hometown, hoping to <br />escape the drug scene, only to find himself moving in with someone who also had <br />a cocaine problem. The whole cycle started over again. <br /><br />At the end of 2016, Reinhardt hit an all-time low. He was at the point of death. He <br />fell on his knees and pleaded with God to step into his broken life. When things <br />could not get any worse, God in His full mercy and grace, stepped in and changed <br />his life completely. Reinhardt and his wife, Mandie Buhr, both experienced God’s <br />salvation and were baptized together. They left a lifestyle of abusing, marijuana, <br />alcohol, and drugs, and began on a beautiful road of salvation and healing. <br />During the biggest transition of his life, Reinhardt was playing a gig one day. As <br />he was playing for hundreds of people, He experienced a voice telling him to make music <br />for God. When Reinhardt made the shift from playing for fame and fortune to <br />playing for Christ Jesus, everything about his music changed! You can even see <br />the transition from his earlier album called “Organic 432hz”, to his latest album <br />entitled “Arise”. <br /><br />To this day, Reinhardt Buhr makes music to God. This is his way of worshiping <br />His Creator and Saviour, Jesus Christ.{% endraw %}
