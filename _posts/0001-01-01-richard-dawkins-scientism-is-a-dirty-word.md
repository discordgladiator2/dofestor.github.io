{% raw %}Freddie Sayers meets Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />Listen to the podcast version: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shows.acast.com/lockdowntv-with-freddie-sayers/richard-dawkins">https://shows.acast.com/lockdowntv-with-freddie-sayers/richard-dawkins</a><br /><br />Read The Post here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unherd.com/thepost/richard-dawkins-scientism-is-a-dirty-word/">https://unherd.com/thepost/richard-dawkins-scientism-is-a-dirty-word/</a><br /><br />We were really delighted that Richard Dawkins agreed to come on LockdownTV to discuss “Scientism” and his new anthology of writing about science literature, Books do furnish a Life.<br /><br />It turns out that Mr Dawkins’ view of “Scientism” is that it is a “dirty word used by people who are critical of scientists” — so that was a relatively brief part of the conversation.<br /><br />On Covid, he is not especially worried about the boundaries of politics and science becoming blurred, but feels that “science is the way to discover the right answer to anything about the real world — and that, of course, includes how to deal with a serious epidemic.” Vaccination and mask-wearing is “not a matter of a set of self interest” it is a “moral responsibility.”<br /><br />Our thanks to Richard Dawkins for sharing his thoughts.<br /><br />// Timecodes //<br />00:43 Literature of science<br />02:19 Scientism<br />04:04 Science and the pandemic<br />05:47 Science and politics<br />07:36 Individuality<br />08:56 Risk<br />09:44 Christopher Hitchens reflections<br />12:24 Post-Christianity<br />13:34 “Books Do Furnish A Life”<br />14:41 Kin selection<br />19:51 A secular future<br />22:09 Politics and religion<br />23:08 Future of morality<br />25:13 Optimism<br /><br />#covid #atheism #scientism{% endraw %}
