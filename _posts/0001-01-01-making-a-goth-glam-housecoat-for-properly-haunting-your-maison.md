{% raw %}Lockdowns may end, but introversion is forever.<br /><br />I finally made a nice long slightly over dramatic robe for lounging around the house. This was rather a quick and easy project to sew together, but it did eat up a lot of fabric of course with this swooshy length. Now I can creepily sit in the dark while I edit with a cozy hood to keep my ears warm.<br /><br />Music and Sound Effects from Epidemic Sound.<br /><br />Where I get my pattern drafting paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://atlaslevy.com/Paper_c_13.html">http://atlaslevy.com/Paper_c_13.html</a> (not sponsored)<br /><br />More from me?<br /><br />Want to help me continue making more videos?

A PO BOX finally wahoo!<br /><br />First, a disclaimer: So many of you have kindly offered to send me things, including vintage items you may have inherited, and I am so honored you would think of me and of course I do adore vintage treasures, however, unfortunately I only have so much storage space currently! So there is a chance that if something just wont work for me, or doesn't fit me etc, that I may not be able to keep all of your lovely things. Please only send things if you are okay with the possibility that I may donate items I just cannot keep. If you would prefer I put things that I can't keep into the TCH Etsy shop to help raise funds for me and the channel, please specify this in a note or letter in your parcel. Thank you so much!<br /><br />Bianca Esposito<br />PO Box 632177<br />Highlands Ranch, CO 80163<br /><br />Thank you for watching!{% endraw %}
