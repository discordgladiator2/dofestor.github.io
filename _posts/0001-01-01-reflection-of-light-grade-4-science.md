A VERY THOROUGH VIDEO! :)<br /><br />This fully comprehensible video is a great resource for teachers for online learning and for students. At the end of this video you will have a thorough knowledge about the science behind LIGHT REFLECTION (a property of light).<br /><br /> 2 experiments are included which you can do at home or with your class. I have done these experiments with my Grade 4 kids and they loved them. Easy to do as groups of 2 or individually or even demonstrate as a class.<br /><br />If you like this video please subscribe to my channel, like and share, for lots more science videos to come :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Carefree by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400037">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400037</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Life of Riley by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400054">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1400054</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br /><br />#ilovefunscience #reflectionexperiment #lightreflectionexperiment #lightandsoundexperiments #lightexperiments #grade4lightexperiments #grade4lightandsound #grade4reflectionexperiments #grade4lightreflection{% endraw %}
