{% raw %}i hope this video is helpful. not just as advice for future applicants, but for those who already survived the process. college admissions are a messy process at the elite level, so i hope this video can be help reframe your mindset. colleges can't tell you whether you are &quot;good enough.&quot; you will always be a valuable and worthy human.<br /><br />getting rejected doesn't make you lesser than. getting in doesn't make you superior. take it from someone who got into a fancy name school, and who knows many fantastic people who didn't and crappy people who did.<br /><br />anyways, good luck with college applications to any current high school students. and to all, good luck with your future educational endeavors! <br /><br />✰ TIMESTAMPS<br />0:00 intro<br />1:17 be yourself<br />2:55 hard work = admissions success<br />6:43 personal qualities are what's really important<br />9:01 polish your essays to perfection<br />10:15 be well-rounded<br />12:01 people who worked hard to go to a state school wasted their time<br /><br />✰ EXTRA EXTRA<br /> ⋅ second channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/jazzydoesntstudy">https://www.youtube.com/c/jazzydoesntstudy</a><br /> ⋅ instagram - @studyquill<br /> ⋅ tiktok lol - @study.quill<br /><br />✰ MY BOOK - Study With Me - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/studywithmebook">http://bit.ly/studywithmebook</a><br />a guide to planning &amp; notetaking techniques for students!<br /><br />✰ THE 'FIT<br /> ⋅ cardigan - thrifted, the tag literally just says CARDIGAN so idk haha<br /> ⋅ necklace - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://enroutejewelry.com/products/lucerne-ripple-necklace?rfsn=5262333.bee0c8">https://enroutejewelry.com/products/lucerne-ripple-necklace?rfsn=5262333.bee0c8</a><br /><br />✰ EQUIPMENT<br /> ⋅ rode videomicpro - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/13ifp/">https://go.magik.ly/ml/13ifp/</a> *<br /> ⋅ panasonic lumix gh5 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/16uvw/">https://go.magik.ly/ml/16uvw/</a> *<br /> ⋅ sigma f/1.4 16 mm lens - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.magik.ly/ml/178vo/">https://go.magik.ly/ml/178vo/</a> *<br /> ⋅ adobe premiere pro<br /><br />any link marked with an asterisk (*) is an affiliate link, meaning i get a commission if you buy anything through my link.<br /><br />✰ MUSIC<br /> ⋅ great days by joakim karud - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud">http://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud</a><br /> ⋅ orange and pomegranate by mark generous - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=16FCA669">https://thmatc.co/?l=16FCA669</a><br /> ⋅ road trip by joakim karud - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud">http://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud</a><br /><br />✰ BUSINESS ONLY - studyquill@select.co{% endraw %}
