{% raw %}General Delawarde of the French Army was live on &quot;Cnews&quot; (french TV news channel) on June 18th .   He was among the signatories of the generals' tribune published in the the french conservative magazine &quot;Valeurs Actuelles&quot;.<br />   In November 2020, commenting on a blog on the results of the American presidential election, Dominique Delawarde had endorsed &quot;the hypothesis of a major fraud&quot;, adding: &quot;There are, in my eyes, too many concordant clues to allow the Western media pack, of which we know who controls it, to convince me of the contrary. On Friday, on CNews, the communicator Claude Posternak asked him &quot;who controls&quot; this &quot;pack&quot;.<br /><br />Retired since the mid-2010s, the general smiled: &quot;You know well who controls the media pack in the world and in France (...) Who controls the Washington Post, the New York Times, at home BFMTV and all the newspapers that come to group around, who are these people...? &quot;The ex-military man pretends to wonder. &quot;Who?&quot;, insists Mr Posternak. And his interlocutor blurts out: &quot;It's the community you know well! &quot;<br /><br />&quot;We're not going to go into that, we're going to stop there, General, I'm sorry. We can't let that be said on air, I'm sorry, we'll cut it off, we'll remove the general,&quot; the show's host, Jean-Marc Morandini, then immediately cuts in.<br /><br />Just saying &quot;It's the community you know well!&quot; was enough to elicite a shitstorm against this brave general.{% endraw %}
