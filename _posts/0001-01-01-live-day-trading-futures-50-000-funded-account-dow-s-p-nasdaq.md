I specialise in trading the world‚Äôs indices / stock markets, especially the US stock markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (US30 / YM), the Standard And Poor‚Äôs 500 (S&amp;P500 / ES) and the NASDAQ (US100 / NQ). <br />Since 2013 I‚Äôve been running a live trade room with my trading partner. Here I have taken thousands of lives trades in front of aspiring traders. Nothing beats live trading for teaching and learning. <br />I want to teach you to be a successful trader where you can generate a consistent and reliable income. <br />If you‚Äôre interested in funded trading tests, I‚Äôve passed them all and the strategies I use are perfect for them because of the controlled, low drawdown. <br />I trade both CFDs and Futures derivatives. <br /><br />üìâ<br />Risk Disclosure: Futures and crypto trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing ones‚Äô financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Hypothetical Performance Disclosure: Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.{% endraw %}
