{% raw %}&quot;Fire/Jericho&quot; is the third single released by the British electronica/rave act The Prodigy on 7 September 1992. It peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart.<br /><br />The single was sub-titled &quot;Strangely Limited Edition&quot; due to the 12&quot; vinyl record being deleted after two weeks. This was to move the focus over to the release of the debut album, Experience, following a few weeks later. Even when the single was re-released, the subtitle was still standing.<br /><br />The song uses the sample &quot;I am the god of Hell fire, and I bring you (fire)&quot; from The Crazy World of Arthur Brown's 1968 single &quot;Fire&quot;. It takes the sampled vocal &quot;When I was a youth I used to burn collie weed in a Rizla&quot; from the track &quot;Hard Times&quot; by Pablo Gad. It also uses an interpolation of the distinct melody in &quot;Kunta Kinte&quot; by the Revolutionaries.{% endraw %}
