All rights reserved to the respective copyright owners.&quot;<br /><br />Anyway, I'd advise consulting YouTube Copyright Center and check the law in your country. I have good news for the U.S. residents: as stated in the Copyright Disclaimer under s. One hundred seven of the Copyright Act #1976 of the USA Copyright code, the so-called &quot;fair use&quot; is allowed.<br /><br />In any case, no matter what country you live in, ideally, you'd need to get a permit from the rights holder. Copyright disclaimers are useless. They can't substitute a permit. And if you got caught by content owners, you would be admitting that you're aware of having violated their copyright, still, you're utterly indifferent to their opinion on the fact you should get permission. Which, ethically speaking, is worse than &quot;accidentally&quot; violating someone's copyright.{% endraw %}
