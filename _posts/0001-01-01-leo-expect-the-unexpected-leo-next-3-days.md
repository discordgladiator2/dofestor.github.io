{% raw %}Hello and welcome to Shared Sentience. Thank you for tuning in! I am an intuitive empath and I use tarot cards, oracle cards, runes, double six dominoes, dice, marbles, and the help of spirit to deliver messages to those in need. I am a Pisces sun, Pisces moon, and a Gemini ascendant. If youâ€™re interested in viewing more of my readings, make sure you subscribe and tap the bell icon to be notified so you donâ€™t ever miss your message! <br />Official Social Media Accounts<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ss_intuitive">https://www.instagram.com/ss_intuitive</a><br />Other channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8NDUej7mHBj_D3xgcsGw4w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8NDUej7mHBj_D3xgcsGw4w</a><br />TikTok: @ss_intuitive<br /><br />*PERSONAL READINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME*<br /><br />There are a few things that I donâ€™t address in the video about myself as a reader, and about tarot itself. Iâ€™m going to address them here:<br />1. Energies can be backwards, roles can be reversed, or I can just be getting messages for/about someone in your energetic field. Apply the roles how they fit, if they fit at all. <br />2. If this message doesnâ€™t resonate, you could also check out readings for your other signs. I do encourage this as it is very important that you get your full message.<br />3. Sometimes messages might not resonate at all, and when that happens, it simply means that thereâ€™s not a message there for you, but it came through for someone. <br />4. These are meant to hit on specific timeframes, but time and energy is fluid, and free will plays a big role in when and if things will or will not occur within a specific timeframe.<br />5. Do not focus too heavily on card gender. Take it however it resonates. <br />6. I do read intuitively. The cards and tools alone have a lot of meanings, but the main source of information are the intuitive messages I receive. <br />7. I am only a messenger and messages are not always what you want to hear.<br />8. Remember that these tools and readings do not dictate your life. This is just energy and energy can change. Readings are really just meant to show you opportunities, possibilities, and to give advice or guidance. This will of course never overpower or replace free will.<br /><br />1.
