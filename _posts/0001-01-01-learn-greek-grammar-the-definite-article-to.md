{% raw %}Learning #Greek without knowing the definite article? Impossible!

Some cases may be surprising!<br />In the end you'll realize that the Greek definite article is very important for many reasons. It can help you identify the gender of a noun, even when it seems impossible. <br />If you are a beginner, you must know that one of the most common mistakes an English speaker may make in Greek is forget the definite article. <br />O Γιάννης είναι φίλος μου - John is my friend.<br />So, enjoy this lesson!<br />In time and through practice you'll be intuitive about the article and you won't even think about it when speaking Greek.<br /><br />For any questions leave a comment!<br /><br /> I would really appreciate it if you could contribute to the translation of this video in your language.
