But after he was exiled and moved to the United States, he would shock the world with his critique of the West, specifically the excessive freedoms he witnessed and the “abyss of human decadence.” <br /><br />What does true freedom mean? Is it possible for a man in a gulag to actually be freer than a man enjoying the greatest wealth the world has to offer? <br /><br />So argues Sohrab Ahmari, op-ed editor of the New York Post and author of “The Unbroken Thread: Discovering the Wisdom of Tradition in an Age of Chaos.”<br /><br />#SohrabAhmari #GulagArchipelago #Freedom <br /><br />- - -<br />👉Watch EXCLUSIVE episodes only on Epoch TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://epochtv.com/ATL">http://epochtv.com/ATL</a> <br /><br />As you all may know, we've been demonetized and suppressed by YouTube over past months, and further YouTube has shown itself to be willing to censor all sorts of important news and content.
