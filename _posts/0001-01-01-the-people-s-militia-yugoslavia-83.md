{% raw %}Carpenter Brut - Hang'em All<br /><br /><br /><br />Formed in 1944, the People's Militia (later just Militia) often worked alongside the constituent Republics of Yugoslavia's Territorial Defence groups and border guards. Meaning that select groups (such as the group in the video from Macedonia) underwent military style training in addition to it's regular police training.<br /><br /><br /><br />I wasn't too happy with the way this one turned out but Mag said it was good and I'll take her word for it.<br /><br />(tfw everyone was using the same 6 minute watermarked footage for their memes and you go into the archives to find the original documentary with 9 views.)<br /><br />Discord: www.discordapp.com/invite/dhd5QD8 <br />Patreon: www.patreon.com/majorsamm <br />Merch!: www.redbubble.com/people/HandleLikeEggs/shop <br /><br />New videos on the 1st and 15th (and sometimes whenever I feel like it.){% endraw %}
