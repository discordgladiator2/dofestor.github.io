{% raw %}Cindy is demonstrating how to transfer in/out of a tub shower using a bathtub TRANSFER BENCH and PROFlex LEG LIFTER.  This tub transfer bench is a good option after knee surgery in order to improve safety with bathing, not having to step over the side of the tub to enter the shower. A HAND HELD SHOWER is another good item to assist in safety and independence while bathing.  <br /><br />Be sure to measure from the bathroom floor to the top edged of the side of the tub. If your tub is taller than normal, extension legs are available.  It is also recommended to have 1/2 inch adjustment heights on the legs for improved leveling of the bench.  <br /><br />Be sure to consult with your surgeon on when you can return to taking a shower after surgery. If you are considering using a shower chair in your tub, please consult with your OT/PT to review safety/technique for your specific circumstances.<br /><br />**Reminder:  Knee replacements can typically still bend at the hips<br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.adaptiveequipmentcorner.com">https://www.adaptiveequipmentcorner.com</a> for more helpful post surgery tips and rehabilitation content.<br /><br />Drive Medical Tub Transfer Bench:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2wgKXv8">https://amzn.to/2wgKXv8</a> (affiliate link)<br /> • Seat Dimensions 18.5-19.5”(D) x 26”(W) x <br />   17.5-22.5”(H)<br /> • Outside Legs 23”(D) x 32”(W)<br /> • 400# weight limit<br />see product link for further product details<br /><br />Vive PROFlex Strap (2-in-1 leg lifter/exercise strap): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2zMcSFQ">https://amzn.to/2zMcSFQ</a> (affiliate link)<br />see product link for further details<br /><br />Leg Lifter Strap by Vive:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2rnKlhR">https://amzn.to/2rnKlhR</a> (affiliate link) <br />see product link for further product details<br /><br />Carex Bath Transfer Bench Extension Legs:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GQhAmy">https://amzn.to/2GQhAmy</a> (affiliate link)  <br />see product link for further product details{% endraw %}
