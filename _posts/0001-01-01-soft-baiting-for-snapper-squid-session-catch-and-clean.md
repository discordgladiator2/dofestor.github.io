{% raw %}Ahoy fisho's! This week I go Inshore soft-baiting for Snapper at one of my favorite local spots. This trip I'm joined by good mate Jimmy Peirson from the Brisbane Bulls &amp; Brisbane Heat Cricket teams to see if we couldn't put a bend in a rod or two. It was a classic early bird gets the worm ordeal with pre-dawn producing some awesome action, then once that tapered off we hit some shallow weed beds in search of a feed of squid! An absolutely cracking day on the water with plenty of action and laughs to be had. Thanks very much for watching, I hope you enjoy the episode!<br /><br />Check out all the gear used in today's video at www.ejtodd.com.au<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ej_todd/">https://www.instagram.com/ej_todd/</a><br /><br />Shop for SHF Merch at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sammyhitzkefishing.com/shop">https://www.sammyhitzkefishing.com/shop</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sammy_hitzke_fishing/">https://www.instagram.com/sammy_hitzke_fishing/</a><br /><br />Jimmy Peirson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jimmypeirson/">https://www.instagram.com/jimmypeirson/</a><br /><br />#snapper #softbait #squid{% endraw %}
