{% raw %}The next amp in our Fender lineup this week is a 1965 Pro Reverb! This beauty is in very good condition with expected wear, and it looks so cool. The amp runs 40w through a pair of 12&quot; Fender Oxford 12L5 speakers providing huge, glassy, three-dimensional clean tones with plenty of headroom for effects. Of course, a nice overdrive once you get above 5 on the volume, giving you a dynamic, versatile vintage Fender combo! Today we've got Jay in to give you the run down on the amp before handing things off to Trevor for a demo with his Pin-up strat!<br /><br />For more information on the amp, please check out:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.emeraldcityguitars.com/product/1965-fender-pro-reverb/">http://www.emeraldcityguitars.com/product/1965-fender-pro-reverb/</a><br /><br />Music: The Hollers &quot;Abandoned Speech&quot; (Instrumental){% endraw %}
