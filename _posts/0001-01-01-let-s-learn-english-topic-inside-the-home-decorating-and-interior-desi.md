{% raw %}Welcome to this English lesson on Decorating and Interior Design.  Houses and apartments are great. They are even better when we take the time to decorate the interior in a way that suits us. As you continue to learn English you will want to be able to talk about the interior of a house or apartment, especially the things you do to the space to make it your own.<br /><br />In this English lesson I will talk about painting, wallpaper, posters, pictures and more! I will help you learn English vocabulary and phrases for talking about decorating your home.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this English lesson!<br /><br />âŒ› Remember:  By tomorrow this video will have auto-generated English subtitles. This can help you to go back and re-watch parts of the lesson that you did not understand.<br /><br />--<br /><br />âœ… Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:<br />ðŸ˜€ðŸ’² If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join</a><br /><br />Becoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:<br />1) For 15 minutes or more at the end of each live stream you will be able to participate in the &quot;Members Only&quot; chat.<br />2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.<br />3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.<br />4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, &quot;Wednesdays with Bob&quot;.
