{% raw %}Welcome back, Richest fans! Celebrities seemingly have a lot of power in the world of business and finance. With a simple gesture or comment on social media, a famous face can cost a company billions of dollars as their millions of followers take notice. Today, we’re going to look at the times celebs wiped mountains of cash from a company’s value within seconds. Including the recent event at Euro 2020 with Cristiano Ronaldo. We also have in the video moments involving LeBron James, Elon Musk, Kylie Jenner, and more!<br /><br />Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you like surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we have Ronaldo and how moving a soft drink bottle cost Coca Cola a fortune. We’ll even see Paul Pogba do something similar at Euro 2020. We then have Elon Musk who has a habit of manipulating the value of firms with a simple tweet. This time, it was Tesla’s stock that took the plunge. We then have Kylie Jenner and her message that badly injured Snapchat’s value. LeBron James issued a public cry for help when his Samsung phone deleted everything. Unfortunately, he was a spokesperson for the company. We have the recent comment by journalist Sucheta Dalal that made the Adani Group take a massive hit. There’s then former president of the US Donald Trump. In a couple of tweets, he nosedived the value of Lockheed-Martin and another plane company. Finally, we’ll briefly look at Wall Street with one of the biggest stock market crashes of all time. <br /><br />Written by: Jordy McKen<br />Narrated by: Adam Newmark<br />Edited by: Andrew Gut<br /><br />Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest</a> ◄<br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:39 Cristiano Ronaldo<br />01:57 Elon Musk<br />03:09 Kylie Jenner<br />04:16 LeBron James<br />05:29 Sucheta Dalal<br />06:46 Donald Trump{% endraw %}
