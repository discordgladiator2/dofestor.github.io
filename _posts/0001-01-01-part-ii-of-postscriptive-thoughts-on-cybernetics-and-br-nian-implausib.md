{% raw %}This is part II of a pre-recorded presentation submitted to The American Society for Cybernetics 2020 Global Conversation held in coordination with The British Cybernetics Society's virtual event &quot;Cybernetics and the 21st Century: Stories of Practice.&quot;<br /><br />Email: rzgllspe@memphisalumni.org<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://zane-gillespie.squarespace.com/">http://zane-gillespie.squarespace.com/</a><br /><br />Regarded nominalistically, implausibilities in art, like any sculpture of sound and duration in music, would only be interpreted as a repeatable artifact (Hasty, 2010), the adequacy of which cannot be judged by reference to human emotion (Evans, 1990), yet with a recursive capacity to provoke an emotional response to its capacity to provoke an emotional response to some value it possesses (Walton, 1993), and which exploits an intrusive defamiliarization that may remain beyond rational explanation (Blackall, 1983).<br /><br />NOTE: The Walton citation is missing in the References, but is supplied here:<br /><br />Walton, K. L. (1993), “How Marvelous! Toward a Theory of Aesthetic Value,” The<br /> Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Vol. 51 No. 3, pp. 499-510.{% endraw %}
