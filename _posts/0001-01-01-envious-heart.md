{% raw %}This film took about 3 years (from early 2003 to late 2006), mostly because I was working on another project I eventually dropped. Then I came back to this one, and I'm glad I did. <br /><br />Hand drawn, scanned into Photoshop, and painted in Photoshop. <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Music: Carmina Burana by Carl Orff <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Special Jury Awards for Best Art Direction of the Festival and Swarovski<br />Designer Award, International Jugendfilmfestival, Kundl, Austria<br />Best of Festival, Digital Days Student Film Festival Santa Barbara<br />Best Animation, Youth Division, Newport Beach Film Festival<br />First Place High School Animation, Best Fest America, La Jolla<br />First Place Animation, Santa Monica Teen Film Festival<br />Best Animation, The International Student Film Festival<br />Best High School Animation, After Hours Film Society Student Shorts, Illinois<br />Selection, Chicago International Childrens Film Festival<br />Selection, Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films<br />Selection, Santa Barbara International Film Festival<br />Selection, Mill Valley Film Festival<br />Selection, Longbaugh Film Festival, Portland<br />Selection, Redstick International Animation Festival, LSU Baton Rouge{% endraw %}
