{% raw %}From Alex Epstein:<br /><br />An understandable reaction to my view that the world should be using more fossil fuels in the coming decades, not less, is &quot;This is the exact opposite of what 'the experts' say. Almost every institution I trust says the expert consensus is that we need to rapidly eliminate fossil fuel use. How can you be right and they be wrong?&quot;<br /><br />On this week's Power Hour (coming out this Friday) drawing on some brand-new material from my forthcoming book Fossil Future, I tackle this question head-on, explaining three ways in which experts are often wrong.<br /><br />When we hear claims that &quot;the experts&quot; are wrong, we usually associate it with the claim that most experts in a field are factually mistaken. While this certainly does happen, there are two far more common ways in which &quot;the experts&quot; can be wrong--both of which are at work on the issue of energy.<br /><br />The factual conclusions of experts can be misrepresented by those who claim to speak for all experts.<br /><br />And the factual conclusions of experts can be misevaluated by those who claim to speak for all experts.<br /><br />In this episode I will show definitively that our knowledge system is wildly irrational in its method of moral evaluation when it comes to not only fossil fuels but also other cost-effective forms of energy.<br /><br />Support the Center for Industrial Progress: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://industrialprogress.com/accelerate​">http://industrialprogress.com/accelerate​</a><br /><br />Purchase The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SOOHPo​">https://amzn.to/2SOOHPo​</a><br /><br />Speaking and media inquiries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://industrialprogress.com/speaking/​">http://industrialprogress.com/speaking/​</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2twmMET​">https://apple.co/2twmMET​</a>{% endraw %}
