{% raw %}On this episode of Expanded Perspectives the guys start the show off talking about the warmer weather here in the United States as well as how Kyle’s father has fallen and hit his head again and is in a hospital in New Jersey! Then, they get into the news where a listener calls in with a Centaur sighting his grandfather had in rural Alabama back before the Great Depression. Then a woman sees a Jinmenken walking near her house.<br /><br />After the break Cam brings up some very strange sightings of both Deer Man and Not Deer!  Sightings of the Deer Man have been reported from several U.S. states, although there is some variation in the descriptions given. A hybrid animal, Deer Man has the antlered head of a great stag, a human’s torso, and legs described as similar to either those of a man or deer. In addition, it is usually said to be well-muscled, and surprisingly fast for its size. Other accounts gift the beast with the power to transform itself from a regular deer into something else entirely. The same can be said about the Not Deer! This elusive creature is said to be very similar to the Deer Man with only slight differences!<br /><br />All of this and more on this installment of Expanded Perspectives!<br />Want to share your story?<br />Email: expandedperspectives@yahoo.com<br />Hotline: 888-393-2783{% endraw %}
