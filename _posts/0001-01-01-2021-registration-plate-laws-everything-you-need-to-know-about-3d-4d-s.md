{% raw %}In today’s video, we discuss everything Number Plates and the rules surrounding them here in the UK. From your bog standard plates, shortened plates all the way to your custom 3D/4D plates, we have got you covered with everything you need to know. <br /><br />Number plate standards are set by DVLA not the Police however it is the Police that have to enforce them. <br /><br />The new BSAU 145e standard replaces the outgoing 145d and are mandatory from 1st September 2021.  After this date only 145e standard number plates can be purchased but 145d can still be used on your car if you already have them. 145e does change some things you can have and hopefully the video explains this for you. <br /><br />The information in this video is correct as of 10th April 2021. <br /><br />Not covered in the video is numberplate character typeface/style and size. This is because there is only one typeface and size allowed. The characters have to conform to this otherwise they won’t meet either 145d or 145e. For instance you cannot have italic or German style writing. <br /><br />I hope you find this informative. Stay safe<br /><br />MPS Owen Messenger<br /><br />Please take a second to let us know your thoughts, and we'll see you all in the next video.<br /><br />Subscribe here and “ Join the GCM Mob ”- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/GCMTHEPT">https://youtube.com/c/GCMTHEPT</a><br /><br />Current Subscriber Count at time of posting this video - 29,000<br /><br />2021s goal is to surpass 100,000 YouTube subscribers.<br /><br />#3D/4D #CustomPlates #RegPlates{% endraw %}
