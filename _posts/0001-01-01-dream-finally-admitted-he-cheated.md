{% raw %}YouTuber Dream has finally admitted to cheating during some of his Minecraft Speedruns. <br /><br />He denied it for months, attacked those who disagreed with him, and went so far as to hire a Harvard-trained astrophysicist to back him up... which, well, backfired.  <br /><br />In admitting he cheated, he also apologized, but it wasn’t really an apology and the response from those who aren’t diehard Dream fans has been one giant scoff. <br /><br />Written &amp; Hosted by: Devin Jones (@milkshks)<br />Edited by: Brendan Fahey (@Drillbit_)<br />Thumbnail by: Brandon Mistele<br />Produced by: Keith Capstick (@KeithCapstick)<br /><br />Have a tip for the Don't @ Me team?
