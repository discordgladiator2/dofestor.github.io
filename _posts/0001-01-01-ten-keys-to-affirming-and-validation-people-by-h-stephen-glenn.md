{% raw %}A very good presentation on how to treat and relate to children from the perspective of parents and educators. Stephen Glenn is the author of &quot;Raising Self-Reliant Children in a Self-Indulgent World: Seven Building Blocks for Developing Capable Young People&quot;<br /><br />This video was given to me by a friend who has used it for many years of teacher training. I have been unable to find other presentations online by Stephen Glenn so I hope that others can gain from it here.{% endraw %}
