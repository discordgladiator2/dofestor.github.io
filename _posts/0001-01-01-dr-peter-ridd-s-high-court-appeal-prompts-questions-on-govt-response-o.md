{% raw %}Sky News host Alan Jones says tomorrow's High Court appeal by Professor Peter Ridd against his dismissal by James Cook University prompts questions of the Morrison government's response to &quot;free speech&quot; in the &quot;out-of-control university system&quot;.<br /><br />Professor Ridd was dismissed in 2018 after he publicly criticised his colleague's research on the Great Barrier Reef.<br /><br />In 2019, the professor challenged the dismissal and was awarded $1.2 million in compensation, but the decision was reversed when James Cook University successfully appealed the decision in the Federal Court.<br /><br />Earlier this year the High Court granted special leave for Professor Ridd to bring on his final appeal.<br /><br />&quot;So tomorrow will be the crescendo of Ridd's five-year legal battle with James Cook University,&quot; Mr Jones said.<br /><br />&quot;Where is the Morrison government?<br /><br />&quot;In March, the same government legislated to require universities to support &quot;freedom of speech&quot; and &quot;freedom of academic inquiry&quot; as recommended by a review undertaken by former Chief Justice, Robert French.<br /><br />&quot;All universities had previously agreed to do that based on a model code, but a government report has shown that, in December last year, six had not done so, including James Cook University.<br /><br />&quot;Well, Minister Alan Tudge, what have you done about it? <br /><br />&quot;And Scott Morrison, what did you mean today, in Question Time, when you said, &quot;Our Government stands up for Australians, for our values and our way of life&quot; â€“ does that include free speech?&quot;{% endraw %}
