{% raw %}SOS we flooded the basement for another PiRATE adventure!!<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! Niko and I are building a Pirate Ship in our basement!! We have gathered our nuggets and couch cushions together and put them together for a giant masterpiece so we can sail the seven seas looking for treasure!! While working really hard I took a break to eat some Cheetos, but those chips always get dust on my fingers so I went to wash my hands. When I was washing my hands, my dad came downstairs and told us that he was going to work. I rushed out of the bathroom and told him to stay but I forgot to turn off the water!! The water filled up in our basement and turned our house into an ocean!! We climbed aboard our pirate ship and went on a pirate adventure!! We got mom to come with us too!! We found sharks, fought an electric eel, and went fishing!! After all of the fun we found a map that told us where a drain was so we could get rid off all the water!! We pulled the drain and the water disappeared!! Water isn't good to have fill up your house but it was really fun playing with my family!!<br /><br />my last video - HOUSE FiRE ESCAPE!! üî• Roblox Family party for Niko‚Äôs birthday!
