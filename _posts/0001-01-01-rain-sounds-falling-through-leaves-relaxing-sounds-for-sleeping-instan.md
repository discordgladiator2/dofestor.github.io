{% raw %}Falling rain sounds falling through the leaves at night. Sleep instantly with gentle rainfall sounds and wake up feeling refreshed. Relaxing sounds for sleeping problems, insomnia, stress reduction, PTSD, anxiety relief, ASMR sleep, tinnitus, nature meditation,  chilling out, soothe a baby, reading, or study. Listen to the light raining sounds as you fall into a deep sleep at night. The sound of rain creates natural white noise that can help drown out distracting background noise so that you can sleep fast and stay asleep longer at night. If you suffer from insomnia or sleeping problems then this soothing rainstorm video may be the answer you are looking for. We hope you enjoy this relaxing rain recording for deep sleeping and insomnia symptoms (sleepless nights, fatigue &amp; tiredness). Please share the rain recording with family and friends if they can't sleep at night.<br /><br />📍 Filmed at Glastonbury, England<br /><br />Our Equipment:<br /><br />GoPro7 Hero Black: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Kkxk4w">https://amzn.to/2Kkxk4w</a><br />Panasonic DMC-G85: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JYcmG7">https://amzn.to/2JYcmG7</a><br />iPhone X: www.apple.com<br />Tascam DR-07X: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MOqLsX">https://amzn.to/2MOqLsX</a><br /><br />🌀 Support Us on PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/stardustvibes">https://www.patreon.com/stardustvibes</a><br />🌀 MP3 DOWNLOADS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stardustvibes.com">https://www.stardustvibes.com</a><br />🌀 Stardust Official Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/stardust-vibes">https://teespring.com/stores/stardust-vibes</a><br />🌀 FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/stardustvibes/">https://www.facebook.com/stardustvibes/</a><br />🌀 INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stardust_vibes/">https://www.instagram.com/stardust_vibes/</a><br />🌀 TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/StardustVibes">https://twitter.com/StardustVibes</a><br />🌀 YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBE: www.youtube.com/c/stardustvibrations?sub_confirmation=1<br />🌀 THIS VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0mkB8m1K2Sc">https://youtu.be/0mkB8m1K2Sc</a><br /><br />You can also listen to selected tracks here:<br /><br />🌀 YouTube Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCzs7Jmi3WImdd0MZvHn6nKA">https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCzs7Jmi3WImdd0MZvHn6nKA</a><br />🌀 Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1XcbmsczGDkYqrqIy8K89H?si=AUtnR8mATz6P6U7D_3AFlQ">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1XcbmsczGDkYqrqIy8K89H?si=AUtnR8mATz6P6U7D_3AFlQ</a><br />🌀 iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/stardust-vibes/1348679070">https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/stardust-vibes/1348679070</a><br /><br />#rainsounds #sleepinstantly #relaxingsounds<br /><br />🛑 IMPORTANT PLEASE READ 🛑 <br /><br />We are a mental health based channel, we do not add commentary throughout our calming music/nature videos as it can detract from the relaxation experience, but we do have affirmations, guided meditations, and behind the scenes videos available. Our channel helps provide relief from stress &amp; anxiety. <br /><br />🎥 Our videos are currently filmed with a GoPro Hero7, Panasonic DMC-G85,  &amp; iPhoneX. We edit, mix, and master the audio in Protools &amp; create the video in Premiere Pro. We occasionally collaborate with other video creators (with legal permission), which we always significantly transform into something new and add our own unique music and sounds.<br /><br />🎶 We create our own music with our own instruments (unless otherwise stated, which is very rarely). My Mother (Elita) and I are both musicians and have played for many years.<br /><br />➡️ For more information on how we create our videos please watch: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hK9lwdqBJQ">https://youtu.be/4hK9lwdqBJQ</a><br /><br />And check out my Instagram page: <br />📷 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sean.thurley/">https://www.instagram.com/sean.thurley/</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This video should not be used to replace any medical or psychological treatment.
