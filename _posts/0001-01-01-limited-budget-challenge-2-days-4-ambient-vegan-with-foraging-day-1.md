{% raw %}This is day 1 of an exercise in which I set myself the task of cooking 6 different meals on a total budget of £4 <br />As usual, there will be rules and permissions - this time though, no animal products, and ambient (shelf-stable) purchased products only. <br />This video contains the shopping, some foraging and Day 1 of the menu. Teleportation is permitted.<br /><br />Day 2 video link will appear here (when I publish day 2):  <br /><br />Here's the link to the foraging (getting started) video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iHPW8Z323F0">https://youtu.be/iHPW8Z323F0</a><br /><br />It's important to note: this is NOT an attempt to 'play at being poor'* (although it did make me appreciate things that I normally take for granted), NEITHER is it an attempt to 'prove that people on benefits could get by with less' (in fact if anything, it proves the opposite - because this was a difficult thing to do - that's why it's called a 'challenge').<br />Primarily, this is an exercise that I set myself specifically to try to provoke a creative response; to nurture or develop transferrable skills of creativity and adaptability.<br /><br />*nor in this case, make any kind of statement about vegan diets.{% endraw %}
