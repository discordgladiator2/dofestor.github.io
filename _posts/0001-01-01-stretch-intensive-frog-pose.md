{% raw %}Welcome to my frog pose stretch intensive class :) We work into frog for a full 15 minutes. This is an advanced stretching video. Breathe and enjoy!<br /><br />As always, feedback is appreciated ❤️ Please leave your thoughts and suggestions below to help me make better videos!<br /><br />***NEW FREE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE EVERY WEEK***<br />Tune in and let me know when you are practicing with me!<br /><br />[Flow With Adee] I am a registered yoga teacher with a B.S. in Exercise Physiology. Movement is essential to a happy, healthy lifestyle and I believe there is a form of movement for everyone. With roots in dance, much of my yoga is free flowing and therefore looks different on every body. That is the beauty of it! Allow your body to MOVE YOU. I hope my classes can provide you some peace and a time to tune in to your body and let go. xx<br /><br />Website:<br />AdisonBriana.com<br /><br />Social Medias:<br />Instagram @AdeeOnEarth<br />Facebook @Flow With Adee<br />Snapchat @Adi.Bri<br />Vegan-Vibrations.tumblr.com<br /><br />Contact Me:<br />AdisonBrianaCoaching@gmail.com<br /><br />Music Credit:<br />Yoga Spirit 2 by Magnus Ringblom licensed under Epidemic Sound{% endraw %}
