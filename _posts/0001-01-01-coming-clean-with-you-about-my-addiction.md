{% raw %}Back in the summer I did an RC car video, almost as a joke. Well, a few companies sent me some real nice cars, and they got me hooked. Now, I'm a full blown RC hobbyist. I get to be a beginner at something again. <br /><br />If you're interested in any of these cars, I suggest you try your local hobby shop before buying them online. Nevertheless, here's what was featured in the video.<br /><br />Land Rover Defender (TRX-4) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://traxxas.com/products/landing/trx-4/">https://traxxas.com/products/landing/trx-4/</a><br />Ford Broncho (TRX-4) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://traxxas.com/products/landing/bronco/">https://traxxas.com/products/landing/bronco/</a><br />Jeep Gladiator (SCX-10) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3h1mBJK">https://bit.ly/3h1mBJK</a><br />Chevy C-10 (SCX-24) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.axialracing.com/products/axi00001t2">http://www.axialracing.com/products/axi00001t2</a><br />Suzuki Jimny (Mini-Z 4x4) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rc.kyosho.com/en/miniz4x4-jimny">https://rc.kyosho.com/en/miniz4x4-jimny</a><br />Jeep Wrangler Rubicon (Mini-Z 4x4)  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rc.kyosho.com/en/miniz4x4-jeep">https://rc.kyosho.com/en/miniz4x4-jeep</a><br />Can Am (Axial Yeti JR) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38lUEs7">https://amzn.to/38lUEs7</a><br />Rat Rod (Unknown) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/37ysP0o">https://amzn.to/37ysP0o</a><br /><br />Berm Peak Jerseys <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection/products/berm-peak-tech-jersey-teal">https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection/products/berm-peak-tech-jersey-teal</a><br /><br />Want us to review your unique mountain bike or outdoor product? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sethsbikehacks.com/product-review/">https://www.sethsbikehacks.com/product-review/</a><br /><br />Check out our main channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/sethsbikehacks">https://youtube.com/c/sethsbikehacks</a><br />Follow me on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sethsbikehacks">https://instagram.com/sethsbikehacks</a><br />Berm Peak Merch <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection">https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection</a><br /><br />Music in this video is from <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg">http://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg</a><br />and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20">https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20</a><br />#RcCars<br /><br />I'm also working on a long-term moonshot project: Building a free public bike park in the Asheville metro area.
