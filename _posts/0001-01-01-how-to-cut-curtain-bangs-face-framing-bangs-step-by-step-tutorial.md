Long time no see! So happy to be back! Keep your eyes peeled and make sure to subscribe, more videos are coming soon ;)<br />Today I'm going to be showing you how to cut curtain bangs! I have been obsessed with these lately. They're a little different from traditional bangs in the way you wear and style them. Typically these are worn parted down the middle, and they feather down the sides of your face. Framing your face and adding shape! They look gorgeous when you wear you hair up or down. Let me know if you need any extra help outside the video on how to wear and cut these!

I try and maintain a healthy diet, which I think plays a part into healthy hair. But I don't use anything to make it thick.<br /><br /><br />Video Camera I Use: Sony HD Handycam CX260V<br />Editing System I Use: Sony Movie Studio Platinum 12<br /><br />*For any business related inquires, you can email me at: lalastar0002@hotmail.com <br /><br />xx Chloe<br /><br />Any links that have a * before them are amazon affiliate links.
