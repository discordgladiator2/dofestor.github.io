{% raw %}8 AMAZING Cordless Drill TIPS that you wish you knew earlier. The cordless drill is perhaps the Holy Grail of Household Tools. Compact, versatile and very handy to have. The cordless drill, hacks, tips and tricks you‚Äôll see in this video should make life a life a little easier when it comes to drilling a hole or driving a screw.<br /><br />Just remember that the cordless drill is a power tool and care must be taken when using one.<br /><br />My recommendation when buying a cordless drill, if you‚Äôre a novice, is go for the mid-priced version. With the cheap cordless drills, you really get what you pay for in terms of longevity and the quality of the drill itself which can be disappointing. The top of the line cordless drills are quite expensive but they are AWESOME! The quality and features on the top models are first class and if your budget allows it, it‚Äôs a no brainer.<br /><br />For most of us however, the mid-priced models will do the trick nicely. For the amount of work you will do with the cordless drill as a novice or weekend warrior, this is all you need. I‚Äôll leave a link below to the drill that l‚Äôve used for years in the copy below. It‚Äôs mid-priced and it also has the Hammer function which is really handy for drilling into masonry products like brick and concrete.<br /><br />I‚Äôll also add a link to a lower priced Cordless Drill that will do the job nicely.<br />The reason l‚Äôve selected these two, apart from their amazing quality for the price, is that unlike the really cheap cordless drills, both of these have the added Hammer Drill function which once you have, you‚Äôll never want to go back!<br /><br />Enjoy the video! üëçüòÅ<br /><br />Before l go on... <br /><br />Link to the Updated Version of my Amazing Makita Cordless Drill. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2pxKK0h">http://amzn.to/2pxKK0h</a><br />Please note that this is American Voltage.<br /><br />Link to the slightly cheaper but still Excellent, DeWalt Cordless Drill. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aRjjEi">https://amzn.to/3aRjjEi</a><br />Please note that this is America Voltage.<br /><br />Tools l Use, Resource Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://diyforknuckleheads.com/tools-resources/">https://diyforknuckleheads.com/tools-resources/</a><br />‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..<br />DIY For Knuckleheads Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://diyforknuckleheads.com">https://diyforknuckleheads.com</a><br />-------------<br />SUBSCRIBE to DIY For Knuckleheads and never miss a video again!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/shaneconlan1">http://www.youtube.com/user/shaneconlan1</a><br />-------------<br />SOCIALS:<br />Please Note: If you intend to submit a Workshop Hack for review, please watch the following video for YOUR submission requirements.
