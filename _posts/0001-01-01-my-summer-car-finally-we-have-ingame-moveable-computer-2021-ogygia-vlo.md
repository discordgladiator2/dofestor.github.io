{% raw %}Computer<br /><br />The Mikropekka computer (full model MIKROPEKKA TURBO X33) is a computer (Fin.png: Tietokone) that can be bought for 6,495 mk after receiving the advertisement for it in the mail, a delivery fee of 60 mk is also added to that price. It can be used by walking to the chair in front of the desk and pressing ‚èé. The computer offers two pieces of pre-installed software: the Pieno program, and the TeleBBS program. The computer play mode can be exited by looking backwards and pressing ‚èé.<br />The computer can be turned on by pressing the power button in front of the case. It can also be reset by pressing the reset button next to the power button. Any games downloaded from Con-Line BBS will be saved to the computer's hard drive indefinitely.<br /><br />Acquisition<br />The computer can be bought by clicking on the advertisement that appears in the mail, then taking the envelope to the post box at Teimo's Shop. The order works in the same way as parts ordered from the parts catalog; the payment happens once the order arrives at the shop, after which it will appear in a cardboard box on the loading dock. The box contains four parts for the computer: the case, monitor, keyboard &amp; mouse, and speakers.<br /><br />Once the parts have been taken home, the computer can be assembled on the desk inside the player's room. Check marks will appear when the parts are hovered over the correct spots, and pressing LMB will place them on the table. The modem will also need to be plugged in to the telephone line in order to access the bulletin board which will require the phone to be unplugged.<br /><br />Makes the ingame computer moveable<br /><br />This mod makes the ingame computer &quot;Mikropekka&quot; moveable along with all its stuff.<br /><br /><br />Note:<br />1.This is very alpha And doesn't save to its location its also pretty janky.<br />2. The computer has to face like it would at the house or the typing won't work.<br />3.Highly recommended to have it on something if you have it on the floor the player will stand up and you can barely see it.<br /><br /><br />everything works like it would with the normal computer. It still runs through house power so if the power bill isn't paid, house is burnt down or a storm knocks out power it will act like it would if its at the table in the house.<br /><br />The game sounds are on the speakers so if you don't have the speakers with you the game sound won't play.<br /><br />I will continue working on this i just thought it was cool to release it early and let other people enjoy it.<br /><br />MOD LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/772">https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/772</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />******************************************************<br />THANKS FOR WATCHING<br /><br />Ôº¨Ôº©Ôº´Ôº• | Ôº£ÔºØÔº≠Ôº≠Ôº•ÔºÆÔº¥ | Ôº≥Ôº®Ôº°Ôº≤Ôº• | Ôº≥ÔºµÔº¢Ôº≥Ôº£Ôº≤Ôº©Ôº¢Ôº•<br /><br />#OGYGIA_VLOGS#Ingame#Moveable#Computer{% endraw %}
