{% raw %}Acappella<br />we have seen his glory<br /><br />This follow-up to the highly successful Rescue, We Have Seen His Glory was originally conceived as a worship-themed production. This was in 1991, well before the modern worship music movement had truly begun in earnest. Halfway through production, the album took a slight detour after a mission trip and song writing session while in the Caribbean Islands, hence came “Talk to Jah,” “I Understand” and “Good Livin”.<br /><br />1 Sing to the Glory 00:00 <br />2 We Have Seen His Glory 02:48 <br />3 Glory in His Name 07:34<br />4 We Will See Jesus 10:38  <br />5 How Can I Truly Say? 14:59 <br />6 Good Livin' 17:22<br />7 Talk to Jah 20:10<br />8 Angels Long to Look into These Things 24:10<br />9 I Understand 29:01<br />10 To Him Who Sits on the Throne 32:36<br /><br />Produced by Keith Lancaster<br />Vocals: Duane Adams, Wayburn Dean, Gary Moyers  and George Pendergrass<br />Songs published by: Anthony K Music and Clifty Music<br /><br />℗ 1991 Word{% endraw %}
