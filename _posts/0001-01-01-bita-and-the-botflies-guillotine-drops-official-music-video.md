She is to be executed but attempts once more to prove her own innocence. <br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Verse:<br />I don’t have the answers,<br />Not one, none at all<br />All I have are rituals,<br />That I hope would work after all<br /><br /><br />Chorus:<br />I’ll kneel not for you<br />I’d steal a prayer or two<br />And whisper them to saner gods,<br />In the name<br />In the name<br />In the name of<br />Someone else<br /><br /><br />Verse:<br />I’m not dark and doomed,<br />Nor irredeemable<br />My ways are not of voodoo,<br />I labor as you do and fall,<br />Vulnerable to instincts<br />And circumstances too<br /><br /><br />Chorus:<br />I’ll kneel not for you,<br />I’d steal a prayer or two,<br />And whisper them to saner gods,<br />In the name<br />In the name<br />In the name of<br />Someone else<br /><br /><br />Verse:<br />A witch begging for<br />Salvation<br />I’m still not sure<br />What my sorry is for<br /><br /><br />Chorus:<br />I know I’m still not<br />The author of that wicked past<br />Neither of the monstrous thoughts<br />You accuse<br />You accuse<br />You accuse me of<br /><br /><br />Outro:<br />You see in front of the starving crowd<br />I’d simply disappoint, they’ve seen it all<br />Surely, they’d want more<br />In their faces, you’d find no trace of triumph<br />And my eyes can attest to that<br />My sea of relief could then gush out<br />Soon as my guillotine drops<br />Soon as my guillotine drops<br />Soon as my guillotine drops<br />Soon as my, my guilty head drops<br /><br /><br />For gigs, collaborations, and projects contact us: bita.andthebotflies@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />Follow us, mga bhiee:<br />Shopee:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shopee.ph/shopbatb?smtt=0.0.9">https://shopee.ph/shopbatb?smtt=0.0.9</a><br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/BitaandtheBotflies/">https://facebook.com/BitaandtheBotflies/</a><br />Instagram: Bita_andthebotflies<br />Twitter: @TheBotflies{% endraw %}
