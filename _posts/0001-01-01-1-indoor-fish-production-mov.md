{% raw %}Alabama Soybean Producers, a division of the Alabama Farmers Federation, is sponsoring a portion of the television show &quot;Time Well Spent&quot;, which is produced by the Alabama Farmers Cooperative. It airs on RFD - TV, which is available on satellite and some cable TV systems.  In this segment, we take a look at Dallas County catfish farmer Butch Wilson's facility, where he's raising thousands of pounds of tilapia in tanks inside a specially constructed barn using a soy-based feed.{% endraw %}
