When all numbers are sorted, the lines will form a complete circle.<br /><br />Check out the program here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/MusicTheorist/ArrayVisualizer">https://github.com/MusicTheorist/ArrayVisualizer</a><br />Visit the channel Discord here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/2xGkKC2">https://discord.com/invite/2xGkKC2</a><br />Check out the Mother 1+2 Restoration project: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/ajQf9Ut">https://discord.com/invite/ajQf9Ut</a>{% endraw %}
