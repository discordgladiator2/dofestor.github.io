{% raw %}Edit: changed the title because I think YouTube doesnâ€™t like the word harass apPaRentLy <br /><br />Hello my gluesticks<br /><br />here are my final ratings for this hate crime attempt: <br /><br />3/10 for execution, was pretty badly planned but y'know points for persistence I suppose <br /><br />1/10 for doxxing, they couldn't find any information on me that I didn't reveal already. 1 point for being able to read at least<br /><br />6/10 for being annoying, it felt like babysitting your child who just learnt how to shout <br /><br />-- <br /><br />Now in all seriousness, this was a whole doozy of an experience. I wore sunglasses so I could be reading the script and pretending I'm looking at the camera but I didn't notice it slipping off so now I just look possessed<br /><br />Check out my instagram and twitter so I can be famous enough to hire a hitman on them guys /j <br /><br />in all seriousness though, if the Applebees are reading this right now- good luck in life man.<br /><br />Also now I know I said I wouldn't make fun of someone's appearance, but what I can say is that Booboo and Amber's combined personality looks like that one potato sack looking evil chef from Ratatouille <br /><br />much love <br />Fal{% endraw %}
