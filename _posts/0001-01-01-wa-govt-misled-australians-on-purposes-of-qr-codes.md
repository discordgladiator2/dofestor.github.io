{% raw %}The Institute of Public Affairs’ Executive Director John Roskam says WA Police admitting to using QR codes to find people is “why people don’t trust the government”.<br /><br />“This app was made mandatory in Western Australia, last year the premier said it will not be used for any other purpose, people can trust it,” Mr Roskam told Sky News host Andrew Bolt.<br /><br />“The police have now admitted that they have used the app to track down an alleged murderer, someone guilty of assault, and the police have not apologised.”<br /><br />Mr Bolt, however, noted “we all want murderers caught” and questioned what was wrong with police simply wanting to track them down.<br /><br />“Well then we can put a microchip behind our ears and give the government all of our information,” Mr Roskam said.<br /><br />“There are limits to what the government should know about us, the government should not mislead Australians.”{% endraw %}
