{% raw %}RAMEN!! When you come to Japan, you know this is a meal not to be missed and Sapporo is home to some of Japan's best ramen restaurants.<br />One place in particular has a long history of serving hungry customers. SAPPORO RAMAE ALLEY or Ganso Sapporo Ramen Yokocho (元祖さっぽろラーメン横丁) in Japanese is located in Sapporo's Susukino entertainment district and provides bowls from 11:00 to past midnight. Miso Ramen is the specialty – the toppings? It can get quite creative! <br /><br />BUTTER <br />CORN<br />CRAB MEAT / LEGS<br />SCALLOPS<br />WOOD EAR MUSHROOMS<br />CHARGRILLED PORK CHASHU STEAKS <br />... are just a few ramen toppings / extras we will try in this episode. <br /><br />Sapporo Ramen Alley started officially in 1951 and many shops have come and gone through the years. Older shops like AJI NO KANRYU have been serving ramen since 1965 which newer shops that came recently have set up vending machine payment services that allow you to see a photo on the machine before paying. <br /><br />I asked why miso ramen was so popular in Sapporo. One shop owner said it's because a department store featured it at a Hokkaido food festival and it just sort of became a hit! <br /><br />Space is limited in many smaller shops, many are counter only -- and popular shops usually have a line out the door at peak times. <br />Best to go early and if you have to wait – there is probably a good reason for it. VERY GOOD RAMEN! <br /><br />In this episode I ate these ramen shops at Ramen Alley:<br />1) Menya Kunimitsu / 麺屋 國光<br />Ramen: Hokkaido Mori Ramen <br />北海道盛りラーメン<br />(Big Hokkaido Ramen) <br />¥1600<br /><br />2) Aji no Kanryu / 味の華龍<br />Ramen: Corn Butter Ramen <br />コーンバターラーメン<br />¥1000<br /><br />3) Teshikaga Ramen / 弟子屈ラーメン<br />Ramen: Chashu Grilled Pork Spicy Miso Ramen <br />チャーシュー焼豚味噌ラーメン<br />¥910<br /><br />GOOGLE MAP:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/e5HZJt1FhCF2">https://goo.gl/maps/e5HZJt1FhCF2</a><br />GANSO SAPPORO RAMEN ALLEY URL: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ganso-yokocho.com/">http://www.ganso-yokocho.com/</a><br /><br />MORE RAMEN? <br />Check out the new FUKUOKA RAMEN GUIDE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGe45KeY-kY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGe45KeY-kY</a><br /><br />JAPAN STREET FOOD SERIES on ONLY in JAPAN<br />Hiroshima (Miyajima Island) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMHSdN1cc4o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMHSdN1cc4o</a><br />Nara <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhZU2JxFkmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhZU2JxFkmo</a><br />Tokyo (Shibamata) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YU0s5WAFr0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YU0s5WAFr0</a><br />Sapporo (Ramen) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MTKUjXUDpI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MTKUjXUDpI</a><br />Kyoto (Nishiki Market) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDAqtVbRux4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDAqtVbRux4</a><br />Osaka (Dotonbori) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9To5UjWhUA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9To5UjWhUA</a><br /><br />SUBTITLES: <br />Community subtitle submissions<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&amp;v=3MTKUjXUDpI">http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&amp;v=3MTKUjXUDpI</a><br />(Post a comment with your name and language if you would like credit.
