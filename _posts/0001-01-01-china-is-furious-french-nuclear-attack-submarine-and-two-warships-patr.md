{% raw %}French Nuclear attack Submarine and two Warships Patrol in South China Sea<br /><br />French nuclear attack submarine was among two navy ships that recently conducted a patrol through the South China Sea, its defence minister announced, in a move likely to anger Beijing, which claims most of the strategic waters as its territory.<br /><br />The SNA Emeraude was accompanied by support ship BSAM Seine for the passage, Defence Minister Florence Parly said on Twitter late Monday.<br /><br />&quot;This extraordinary patrol has just completed a passage in the South China Sea. A striking proof of the capacity of our French Navy to deploy far away and for a long time together with our Australian, American and Japanese strategic partners,&quot; she tweeted along with a picture of the two vessels at sea.<br />__________________________________________________<br />Subscribe : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jSlCN2">https://bit.ly/3jSlCN2</a>{% endraw %}
