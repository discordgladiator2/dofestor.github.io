{% raw %}Hello Guys! In this video, I'll be telling things that you shouldn't be doing in Grand Piece Online!! If you guys like this video and want to see more content make sure to leave a like and subscribe if new!<br />----------------------------<br />What is ROBLOX? <br />ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18-year-olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.<br />💥💫👻<br />THE INTRO SONG ISNT MINE, OWNED BY BARK! <br />FULL CREDIT OF THE SONG GOES TO THEM!<br /><br />THE INTRO SONG IS OWN FULLY BY THE OWNER<br />I DO NOT OWN THE SONG!<br />FULL CREDIT TO HIM<br /><br />#Roblox  #GPO  #GrandPieceOnline #One Piece{% endraw %}
