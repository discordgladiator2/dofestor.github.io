{% raw %}This is a song by Mads Langer . I've first heard this song on ABC's show 'Castle' and I instantly fell in love with it. So I made a lyric video!!. I enjoyed making this video and I hope you all enjoy singing along with it too.<br /><br /><br /><br />**************************************************<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />magine a world without me - say you're falling apart<br /><br />Let's pretend you've missed me for a while<br /><br />Wouldn't you say you were lonely and love was breaking your heart?<br /><br />Put on your Sunday best and fake a smile<br /><br /><br /><br />I dream of dreaming dreams of her - in twilight she's a constant blur<br /><br />The picture is clear and I'm still fact she's fiction<br /><br /><br /><br />Remember the night you were with me - fell asleep by my side<br /><br />Strangers together - your hand in mine<br /><br />How come we never came closer when all the stars were aligned?<br /><br />I thought we had a moment<br /><br /><br /><br />I dream of dreaming dreams of her - in twilight she's a constant blur<br /><br />The picture is clear and I'm still fact she's fiction<br /><br />I seem to miss the missing part, she's still my favorite work of art<br /><br />The picture is clear and I'm still fact she's fiction<br /><br /><br /><br />Nothing has changed cause I'm still fact - she's fiction<br /><br />Or I may be imperfectly formed in this contradiction<br /><br /><br /><br />I dream of dreaming dreams of her - in twilight she's a constant blur<br /><br />The picture is clear cause I'm still fact she's fiction<br /><br /><br /><br />I fell in love with her longing - let's just say that she never found out<br /><br />Who it was she never found in me <br /><br /><br /><br />*****************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />I own nothing in this video.
