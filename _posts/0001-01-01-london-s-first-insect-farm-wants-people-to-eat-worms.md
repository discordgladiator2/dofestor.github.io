{% raw %}Horizon Insects is an insect farm in London that rears thousands of edible worms and crickets. The farm prioritizes sustainability and uses leftover food from local businesses to feed the insects. Mealworms are the easiest and most energy efficient insects that the farm grows. The worms only need 10% of the land used for beef, and they produce far less CO2.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />INSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.
