{% raw %}You are going to die eventually. Will you fill whatever lifetime you have left with so-called time management techniques and shortcuts? Or will you see time management as a way to infuse your life with meaning and purpose?<br /><br />Brad Aeon studies time. Thank you for your time. Aeon is a Ph.D. researcher at the John Molson School of Business focused on time management, temporality, and work-life balance. He focuses on the improvement of our temporal decision-making as a solution to achieving more success by leading a less busy life. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
