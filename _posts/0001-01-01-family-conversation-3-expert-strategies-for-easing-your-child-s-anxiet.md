{% raw %}The last Family Conversation in our 2021 spring series was focused on helping make life feel lighter, happier, and more manageable in the face of the pandemic. Parents and caregivers asked questions like: <br /><br />• How do I know if my child’s behavior is stress-related or not? <br />• What can I do to make my kiddo feel secure when I don’t feel okay myself? <br />• When talking with my child about the pandemic, how do I know what they’re ready to hear? <br />• How do I help my child get back to their joyful, playful self?  <br /><br />In this discussion, Kate Jordan-Downs and Taunya Banta from our education leadership team offer tips for easing stressors that are impacting your child during the pandemic. From creating routines to meeting your child’s questions with honesty, we discuss how grownups can help kids feel better. Learn more about our programs for kids ages 6-weeks to 6th grade, and find a center near you.{% endraw %}
