{% raw %}The ENFP personality type is one of the 16 different types identified by the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). ENFPs are both &quot;idea&quot;-people and &quot;people&quot;-people, who see everyone and everything as part of a cosmic whole. They want to both help and to be liked and admired by other people, on both an individual and a humanitarian level. This is rarely a problem for the ENFP, as they are outgoing and warm, and genuinely like people. <br /><br />Are you wondering if you have the ENFP personality type? <br /><br />Disclaimer: This video is based on the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI), a theory on personality types based on rough tendencies rather than strict classifications. <br /><br />Previously, we also made a video on the signs you're an INFJ, the rarest personality type: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/D89N3_fFwrA">https://youtu.be/D89N3_fFwrA</a><br /><br />Writer: Xinyi <br />Script Editor: Rida Batool <br />Script Manager: Kelly Soong <br />VO: Amanda Silvera <br />Animator: Billie (new animator) <br />YouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong   <br /><br />References: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3tRaEvn">https://bit.ly/3tRaEvn</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJEpR7JmS36tajD34Gp4VA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJEpR7JmS36tajD34Gp4VA/join</a><br /><br />Would you like to animate for the team?
