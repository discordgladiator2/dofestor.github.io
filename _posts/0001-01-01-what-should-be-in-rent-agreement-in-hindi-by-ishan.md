{% raw %}What should be in rent agreement in Hindi | By Ishan<br /><br />A lease or rental agreement sets out the rules landlords and tenants agree to follow in their rental relationship. It is a legal contract, as well as an immensely practical document full of crucial business details, such as how long the tenant can occupy the property and the amount of rent due each month.<br /><br />While standard rental agreements are a good starting point, not all include all the necessary terms they should include. Even if all you want is a simple rental agreement between you and your tenant, there are some important terms which should be included in every rental agreement. Whether you need a home rental agreement, an apartment rental agreement or a room rental agreement, you should use a rental agreement that includes the following terms and/or clauses:<br /><br />1.Names of all parties to the agreement, including all adult tenants. It’s important that your rental agreement includes the names of not only you and your main tenant, but also all the other adults who will be occupying the premises. This ensures that all adults who will be living on your rental property are responsible for the duties and obligations of the tenant as outlined in the agreement, including the payment of rent. It also means you’ll be able to terminate the rental agreement if any one of the tenants violates the terms of the lease. If you only list one person as tenant, and any of the other occupants who aren’t listed violates an important term of the lease, you will have less options.<br /><br />2.The term of the tenancy. This clause will set out whether the rental agreement is a month-to-month rental agreement, which will run from month to month unless you, the landlord, or the tenant terminates it, or whether the agreement is a lease agreement for a fixed term. Lease agreements are typically for a fixed term of one year, with the agreement setting out options for renewal on the expiry of the fixed term. Termination options should also be addressed.<br /><br />3.Rent. Your rental lease agreement should have provisions that spell out the amount of rent that’s due, when the rent payments are due, and how the rent payments should be paid.<br /><br />4.Limits on occupancy/subleasing. This important provision ensures that only those who have signed the lease, along with their minor children, can live on the rental premises. Tenants will also not be able to sublease the premises to another party without your approval.<br /><br />5.Security deposits and other fees. Security deposits are often very contentious issues between a landlord and tenant, so it’s important that your rental agreement is very specific about all matters related to the security deposit. This includes not just the amount of the deposit, but issues such as when and how the deposit may be used and when and how the deposit is to be returned. Your agreement should also cover what kinds of fees (for example, cleaning or repair fees) can be deducted from the security deposit. You should also check your state’s laws relating to security deposits, as they may set out certain requirements with which you will need to comply.<br /><br />6.Repairs and maintenance. Both you and your tenant should have particular maintenance obligations under the rental agreement, and these should be clearly set out in the terms. The tenant, for example, should be responsible for maintaining clean premises, as well as be responsible for any damage he or she causes. The terms should also obligate your tenant to inform you of any repairs that need to be made to the premises for which you are responsible.<br /><br />7.Right of entry. Not making necessary repairs can place you in violation of the lease, but what if your tenant won’t provide you with the access required to make such repairs? Your rental agreement should specify the conditions under which you are allowed to enter the rental property, and also what notice is required prior to entry. Because state law often regulates a landlord’s right of entry, you should check to make sure the provisions set out in your rental agreement conform with legal requirements.<br /><br />8.Disruptive behavior and illegal activities. Your rental agreement should have provisions which clearly state what constitutes disruptive behavior (for example, excessive noise) and illegal activities (for example, dealing drugs) and prohibit such behavior and activities.
