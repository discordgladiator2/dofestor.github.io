{% raw %}ATL's Yung Bans has been nothing short of making a name for himself. The 18-year-old previously found himself in unfortunate circumstances but now his focus is making his musical vision come together. Featured on multiple outlets for his recent track, &quot;No Mercy,&quot; Bans is doing a good job at getting his music out there. And honestly, he didn't have to do much since Yachty previewed his Yung Icey-produced track, &quot;Right Through You,&quot; on his snapchat and his track, &quot;4Tspoon&quot; featuring Playboi Carti, has been streaming nonstop. <br /><br />So now that his track has been supported by a major artist and multiple outlets, what's next? A video, of course. The visual for &quot;Right Through You&quot; -- produced and directed by Lonewolf-- features Bans in his natural elements with a loomy vibe to it. And if you don't get what Bans is talking about, well in lamer terms: fuck all of those that claimed to be day ones but really weren't. <br /><br />Check out the visual for Yung Bans' &quot;Right Through You&quot; and if you haven't already, check out &quot;No Mercy.&quot; <br /><br />Follow &amp; Subscribe to HotNewHipHop to stay updated on exclusive behind the scenes, interviews, music videos &amp; more from your favorite artists:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hotnewhiphop.com">http://hotnewhiphop.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hnhh.co/yosub">http://hnhh.co/yosub</a> (Subscribe)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fb.com/realhotnewhiphop">https://fb.com/realhotnewhiphop</a> (Like)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hotnewhiphop">https://twitter.com/hotnewhiphop</a> (Follow)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/hotnewhiphop">https://instagram.com/hotnewhiphop</a> (Photos){% endraw %}
