You’ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.<br /><br />I made this modern bedframe out of sustainably grown teak. It is grown on a farm and harvested after 10-12 years which is really fast for a hardwood.  I designed a really simple bedframe with a French cleat headboard. I designed these heavy duty hairpin legs and had Semi Exact produce them. They have an 8” L-bracket which reinforces the corners of the bed frame and are made in America! These were a prototype and Semi Exact is considering offering them as a product if there is enough interest so click this link and tell them what you think.<br />Here is a link to learn more<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://semiexact.com/pages/teak-bed-hairpin-legs">https://semiexact.com/pages/teak-bed-hairpin-legs</a><br /><br />Link to the plans:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gum.co/MMqoO">https://gum.co/MMqoO</a><br />you can download them for free or tip if you want. <br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/benjaminuyeda/">https://www.instagram.com/benjaminuyeda/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />For additional projects and information check out our website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.homemade-modern.com/">http://www.homemade-modern.com/</a>{% endraw %}
