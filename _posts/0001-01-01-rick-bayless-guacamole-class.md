{% raw %}GET THE RECIPE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/guacamole/">https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/guacamole/</a><br /><br />More than any recipe in the Mexican canon of classics, guacamole evolves and transforms into what the cook likes or what is right for the occasion. In Mexico, guacamole tends toward simple because it’s most often destined to be a condiment for tacos and the like. <br /><br />In the U.S., guacamole explodes with complexity, often chock-full of vegetables, since here we almost always scoop it up with chip after chip. While many contemporary creations have been written (I confess to have written many of them myself), there is a traditional foundation from which all of them spring: Coarsely mash thoroughly ripe avocados, seasoning with salt and just enough lime to brighten (but not overwhelm) the avocado richness.<br /><br />Add emblematic Mexican vegetables to suit your own taste: white onion for fresh crunch, ripe tomato for sweetness, fresh green chile for that spicy zing, and cilantro for herby aroma. It’s that simple, though this approach requires the one in charge of preparation to understand the role of each ingredient they’re adding and to taste regularly until the perfect balance is achieved. So making your perfect guacamole requires a fair amount of experience, of trial-and-error. But I can think of quite a few less rewarding endeavors.{% endraw %}
