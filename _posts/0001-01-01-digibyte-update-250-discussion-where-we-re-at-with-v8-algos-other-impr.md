{% raw %}We're going to talk about DigiByte! This will be a summary episode of the DigiByte Update, to update you on where things are at with Development, Algorithms, new improvement proposals etc <br /><br />So come along, ask any question you want (Except price predictions - I don't do those but anything else is fine) and let's have some fun!<br /><br />Current topic list will hopefully include:<br />* HDD mining<br />* Performance improvements<br />* Looking at scaling<br />* Staking<br />* Mining % rewards<br />* GPU mining<br />* CPU mining<br />* Phone-based mining<br />* Getting DigiByte on more App Stores<br />* Mobile applications<br />* Transaction fees<br />* One-click miner possibilities<br />and more!<br /><br />I'm hoping to pack a bunch of stuff in so it'll probably go for an hour or two and you can always rewind to watch more afterwards if you can't make it live.<br /><br /><br />Currently submitted community questions:<br />* Is the Digital Dollar... , #DUSD a stablecoin on the DigiByte blockchain really gonna happen? Would it require a hard fork?<br />* What changes will occur when RandomX and progPOW is deployed? Does this create more security?<br />* Can you explain the public Gitchat that will streamline communication for DigiByte developers? Is this just a private platform for them to work together more effectively? Thanks<br />* Could we implement something like ChainLocks (from Dash) to help with confirmation speeds?<br />* DigiByte in El Salvador? And do we still have projects running in Venezuela?<br />* Are we still looking at a supply emissions change? If we do make changes to this when is it likely to be implemented?<br />* Will be a donation feature on the new miner where you could donate X amount of minutes every 24 hours for digibyte developers or marketing or DGBAT or any other choices we could pick from?{% endraw %}
