so let's keep keep keep it that way<br /><br />The world's still changing<br />A lot more of what we do is free<br />There might be work that still needs to be done<br />But since we've grown there's a lot more to you and me<br /><br />We kept it in because we both liked the that way it was<br />We'd sneak around for fun but now we're both so much in love<br />It was this little secret that we kept between you and me<br />And now we shout it out for the world to see<br /><br />I feel it in my blood<br />I feel it in my bones<br />It's kinda fun declaring everyone knows<br />The secret is ours, or that's what we used to say<br />We're the &quot;best of friends&quot;
