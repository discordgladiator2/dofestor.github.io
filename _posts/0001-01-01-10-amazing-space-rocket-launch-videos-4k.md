{% raw %}Space launch is the earliest part of a flight that reaches space. Space launch involves liftoff, when a rocket or other space launch vehicle leaves the ground, floating ship or midair aircraft at the start of a flight. Liftoff is of two main types: rocket launch (the current conventional method), and non-rocket space launch (where other forms of propulsion are employed, including airbreathing jet engines or other kinds).<br /><br />Rocket launch is the only current way to reach space. In some cases an airbreathing (jet engine) first stage has been used as well.Non-rocket space launch is a launch into space where some or all of the needed speed and altitude are provided by something other than expendable rockets. A number of alternatives to expendable rockets have been proposed. In some systems such as Skyhooks, rocket sled launch, and air launch, a rocket is used to reach orbit, but it is only part of the system.{% endraw %}
