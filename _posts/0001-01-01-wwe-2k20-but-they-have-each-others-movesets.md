{% raw %}Today I played WWE 2K20 but I switched Randy Orton and Matt Riddles movesets! Randy will have Riddle's moveset and vice-versa. I know this is super short but that was not my intention lol! I found this video pretty funny so I figured I'd upload it. Let's see if we can get 6,000 likes! <br /><br />You can watch the &quot;WWE 2K20 But I Changed Everyone's Finisher!&quot; video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KyG_w_zh10g">https://youtu.be/KyG_w_zh10g</a><br /><br />#WWE2K20 #WWE<br /><br />Rock the merch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/bdeshop">https://teespring.com/stores/bdeshop</a><br /> - Send a picture of you with the merch for a shout out!<br /><br />Get 20% off your order when you use code &quot;BDE&quot; at checkout!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rockemsocks.com/bcollymore">https://rockemsocks.com/bcollymore</a><br /><br />Stay Connected!<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/itsbrandonde">https://twitter.com/itsbrandonde</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bcollymore">https://www.instagram.com/bcollymore</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/brandondoeseverything">https://twitch.tv/brandondoeseverything</a> <br />TikTok: bcollymore<br />Snapchat: blackyishere<br /><br />Business Email: etrauma214@gmail.com<br />Serious Inquiries Only!<br /><br />WWE 2K20 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports. It was released worldwide on October 22, 2019, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the twenty-first game in the WWE game series and the seventh under the WWE 2K banner.<br /><br />I got this idea because &quot;The Viper&quot; Randy Orton used &quot;The Original Bro&quot; Matt Riddle's finisher (Bro Derek) on Monday Night RAW. Riddle also used the RKO on RAW. This video was super funny/hilarious and I had a blast filming it!{% endraw %}
