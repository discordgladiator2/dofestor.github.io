The video contains their exclusive actions in Russia - Moscow and St. Petersburg.<br /><br />Graffiti is not a crime. What graffiti artists demonstrate on the streets is art. A crime is advertising, whose aim is commercial benefit. Advertising encourages you to consume, but our art forces you to think. People in their egoistic individualism have forgotten about universal humanity which is under threat of the total extinction of everything living. Our art is directed at those to whom it is still possible to knock sense into.<br /><br />#GRAFFITI #ГРАФФИТИ #vivacity <br />Граффити на поездах и электричках.{% endraw %}
