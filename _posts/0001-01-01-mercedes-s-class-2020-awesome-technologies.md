{% raw %}2018-2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class takes another major step towards autonomous driving, elevating Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive to the next level. The range of driving assistance and safety systems features a modular design and as standard includes Active Braking Assist, Crosswind Assist, ATTENTION ASSIST, Traffic Sign Assist and also the occupant protection system PRE-SAFE.  New and also part of the standard specification is PRE-SAFE Sound (prepares human hearing for the anticipated accident noise when there is a risk of a collision).<br />Active Distance Control DISTRONIC and Active Steering Assist now provide even more comfortable support for the driver to keep a safe distance and steer. The speed is now adjusted automatically ahead of bends or junctions. This is complemented by a considerably improved Active Lane Changing Assist and additional functions of the Active Emergency Stop Assist (country-specific variations may occur in terms of the individual functions). <br />Thanks to enhanced camera and radar systems, the new S-Class has an even better view of the surrounding traffic: In addition, for the first time it makes use of map and navigation data to calculate driving behaviour.<br />This means that DISTRONIC Active Proximity Assist is able to assist the driver in many situations based on the route, and conveniently adjust the vehicle speed.<br /><br />If you love cars you should subscribe now to YouCar the world famous automotive channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/5i54Vg">https://goo.gl/5i54Vg</a><br /><br />Music: But Enough About Me, Bill Paxton by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/dtv/">http://chriszabriskie.com/dtv/</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/">http://chriszabriskie.com/</a><br /><br />#sclass #mercedes #luxurycar{% endraw %}
