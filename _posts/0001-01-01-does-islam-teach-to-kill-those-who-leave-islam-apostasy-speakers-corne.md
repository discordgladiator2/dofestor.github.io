Rather &quot;we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God.&quot; Our motivation is love for Muslims to bring them to repentance and faith in Christ for eternal life.<br /><br />*Disclaimer- Speakers Corner, London UK, is a unique place in the world for freedom of Speech.
