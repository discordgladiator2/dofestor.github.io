{% raw %}Cabinets<br /><br />Automated Punching, Bending Line Video of Cabinets<br /><br />For the production of office, drawer and filing cabinets, our bending machines offer possibilities for products of various sheet thicknesses (0.4 to 1.25 mm). By integrating different processes and a robot cell within one single machine concept, these machines are able to produce a complete cabinet. Moreover, in combination with our standardised modular construction, you can easily expand your production process at no extra cost.<br /><br />Product<br /><br />Our bending machines produce office, drawer and filing cabinets from different materials, such as normal steel and pre-painted steel. This enables you to produce a wide range of cabinets. All panels can be separately produced. If necessary, the entire cabinet can be welded together with the help of a robot cell.<br /><br />Machine<br /><br />With our bending machines, we can not only deliver a high productivity for the shelves, but also a high flexibility for the complex doors and side panels with special door and catch shapes. Our machines deliver the highest output (up to 8 panels per minute) for a stand-alone machine concept. Our bending machine also delivers a logistical saving by the innovative production of profiles on the same machine.<br /><br />More information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wemomachines.com">http://www.wemomachines.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wemomachines.com/en/solutions/storage/cabinets/">http://www.wemomachines.com/en/solutions/storage/cabinets/</a>{% endraw %}
