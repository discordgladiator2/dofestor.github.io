With a CEASE construction order we are feeling anxious about the future of this cabin. <br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE for a new video every single Sunday <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2DDSUgu​​​">http://bit.ly/2DDSUgu​​​</a><br />► The vlog continues on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/eamonandbec​​​">https://instagram.com/eamonandbec​​​</a><br /><br />In 2017 we bought our first sprinter van and spent 30 days renovating it into our dream tiny home. The plan was to van life around the world and we'd made it all the way from Canada to Africa. Fast forward to COVID...us abandoning our van in a Moroccan parking lot, flying home to Canada, converting yet another van, and then moving to our cabin in the woods.<br /><br />We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international van life travels. As amateur renovators and first time home owners we've done our best but it turns out we've made a lot of costly mistakes along the way. After being tattled on to the township, we had a visit from a building inspector who has now put a CEASE CONSTRUCTION order on us. What will we do next?<br /><br />Catch up on Eamon &amp; Bec's cabin in the woods videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mNAcpX​​​">https://bit.ly/3mNAcpX​​​</a><br /><br />Eamon &amp; Bec Products<br />↠ handmade chai blends <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chaiwalachai.com/​​​">https://chaiwalachai.com/​​​</a> ↞<br />↠ cookbook &amp; merch <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eamonandbec.com/">https://eamonandbec.com/</a> ↞<br /><br />Get Caught up on our Van Life Adventures:<br />Building Off-Grid Tiny House During Pandemic <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Y0KGIJ">https://bit.ly/2Y0KGIJ</a><br />VAN TOUR | Sprinter Van Converted to Tiny Home <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KwcowOqSzbc">https://youtu.be/KwcowOqSzbc</a><br />BACK TO VAN LIFE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EdVvjlMh4x0">https://youtu.be/EdVvjlMh4x0</a><br /><br />Musicbed SyncID:<br />MB0176GUYU857NE{% endraw %}
