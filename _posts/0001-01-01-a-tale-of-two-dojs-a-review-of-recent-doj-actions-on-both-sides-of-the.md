{% raw %}President Biden's Department of Justice under the leadership of Attorney General Merrick Garland has been a mixed bag. This video reviews several recent DOJ decisions, from police department &quot;Pattern or Practice&quot; investigations, civil rights prosecutions and high profile subpoenas of folks like Rudy Giuliani to DOJ's decision in the lawsuit for the clearing of protestors from Lafayette Square and the recent decision in the E. Jean Carroll case. Specifically, this vide contains a review of the DOJ's legal rationale for filing an appeal in the Carroll case and the pros and cons of the position DOJ has decided to take in that case. <br /><br />For our newly launched Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/</a><br /><br />Please consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner">https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner</a><br /><br />My podcast, &quot;Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner&quot; can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.<br /><br />Follow me on:<br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/glennkirschner2">https://www.twitter.com/glennkirschner2</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/glennkirschner2">https://www.facebook.com/glennkirschner2</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/glennkirschner2">https://www.instagram.com/glennkirschner2</a>{% endraw %}
