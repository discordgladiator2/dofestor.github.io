{% raw %}After a long wait of 5 years, the Woodlands Bus Interchange is reopened with bigger and better facilities to serve the community of Woodlands, Marsiling and Admiralty.<br /><br />The Interchange was initially closed to facilitate building works for a new underground linkway to the new Woodlands Thomson East Coast Line station. <br /><br />Concurrently, the interchange was given a revamp which includes conversion from an underground open-air concept to a fully air-conditioned space as well as the reconfiguration of parking lots and berths for boarding and alighting.<br /><br />Four services (925/925M, 950, 961/961M and 965) will still operate from the temporary bus interchange site nearby that has served the entire Woodlands area amidst the construction and upgrading period.  <br /><br />This video is a showcase of the new interchange as well as filming a variety of bus movements in and out from the two entrance/exit areas that had been an iconic part of its identity since its start in February 1996.{% endraw %}
