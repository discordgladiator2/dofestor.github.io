{% raw %}For the February meeting of the Houston Clutter Coaching meetup, we were pleased to welcome guest speaker Rosa Glenn Reilly, the founder and director of the Spectrum Center in Houston. Rosa enjoys a successful consulting practice working with individuals and couples in the areas of intimacy, adult development, and crisis and trauma resolution, with a special focus on primary-care providers. Her gentle yet direct approach includes a body-centered psychotherapeutic methodology with a non-denominational spiritual awareness.<br /><br />In this session, Rosa discussed how the things that we collect reflect our inner life. She explored the emotional roots of clutter and the mental blocks that prevent us from letting go.{% endraw %}
