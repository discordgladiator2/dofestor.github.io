{% raw %}The Gerber Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Knife may be the most hated knife ever made.  You don't have to look very hard online to find lots of people trashing this knife and calling it a total piece of junk.  I happen to like Gerber knives, so I have wanted to see for myself for a while now whether the knife was any good.  After I damaged my Gerber Profile knife while doing a review, I contacted Gerber and they agreed to warranty the Profile.<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3zAQMQHyUo&amp;list=PLlvBLL5-fJbgbKoae4YsdqNm-MzHC8F7n&amp;feature=share&amp;index=24">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3zAQMQHyUo&amp;list=PLlvBLL5-fJbgbKoae4YsdqNm-MzHC8F7n&amp;feature=share&amp;index=24</a><br /><br />Since the Profile knife is out of production, Gerber was willing to send me a Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Knife as a replacement for the Profile to review and make up my own mind. In this longer than usual video I put the knife through a standard Survival On Purpose knife review and pushed it a little extra hard, just to see what would happen.
