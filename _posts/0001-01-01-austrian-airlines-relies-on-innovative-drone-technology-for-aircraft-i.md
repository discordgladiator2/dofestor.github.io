{% raw %}Since the middle of the year, Austrian Airlines has been testing a completely new technology for the purpose of carrying out technical inspections of its aircraft fleet. The aircraft are checked for paintwork or structural damage by means of autonomous drones developed by the French startup “Donecle”. This innovation not only reduces the workload for technicians of Austria’s national carrier, but the shorter duration of the checks lasting less than two hours instead of the previous time required of four to ten hours enables quicker availability of the aircraft in daily flight operations.   <br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to the Austrian Airlines YouTube Channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/austrianairlines">https://www.youtube.com/austrianairlines</a><br />Follow our Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.myaustrianblog.at">https://www.myaustrianblog.at</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/AustrianAirlines">https://www.instagram.com/AustrianAirlines</a><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AustrianAirlines">https://www.facebook.com/AustrianAirlines</a><br />Follow us on LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/Austrian-Airlines">https://www.linkedin.com/company/Austrian-Airlines</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/_austrian">https://twitter.com/_austrian</a><br />Follow us on Flickr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/austrianairlinespress">https://www.flickr.com/photos/austrianairlinespress</a>{% endraw %}
