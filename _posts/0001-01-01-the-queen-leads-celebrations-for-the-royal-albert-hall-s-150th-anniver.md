{% raw %}The Royal Albert Hall - of which the Queen is Patron - celebrated the 150th anniversary of its opening this week. <br /><br />Queen Victoria opened the Royal Albert Hall in 1871 as a tribute to her late husband, Prince Albert. <br /><br />The famous London venue has hosted many members of the Royal Family over the years: William and Kate's recent BAFTAs attendance and Harry and Meghan's standing ovation during their penultimate official engagement are among some of the memorable recent appearances. <br /><br />#RoyalAlbertHall #Birthday #TheQueen{% endraw %}
