{% raw %}We asked Goro Takada to design and build a wood shade that could be assembled in the spring and easily taken apart for storage in the winter!  He came up with a great design and we built and installed it together on June the 3rd.  So from now on each year I will be setting up and taking down this wood shade for our summer Jozankei Onsen green season.  Stop by and check it out while enjoying a great soft ice cream!<br /><br />If you like this design and have an interest in buying one for your home, please contact Mr. Takada directly through his website.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.takada-atelier.com/">https://www.takada-atelier.com/</a><br /><br />I recommend Specialized bikes!
