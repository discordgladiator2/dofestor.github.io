{% raw %}Keith Cooper makes several A3+ (13&quot; x 19&quot;) colour prints on fine art matte art papers with the ET-8550.<br /><br />The Epson 13&quot; EcoTank printer has both dye and pigment black inks meaning that it prints somewhat differently at some media settings to normal dye or pigment based printers.<br /><br />Using Epson Hot Press Bright and a Hahnemuhle rag paper with custom ICC printer profiles, Keith shows how even quite similar papers can perform quite differently.<br /><br />The mixed ink set of the 8550 includes matte black and photo black inks, where the matte black is used at some print settings (VFA) to increase the depth and neutrality of blacks. The mixed ink set means that more care than usual is required in paper selection for optimal results.<br /><br />In particular, the results are quite different to printing black and white photos as described in the 8550 B&amp;W video at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/aVJ7xjQ4OCQ">https://youtu.be/aVJ7xjQ4OCQ</a><br /><br />There is more in the 'Choosing the best paper' article at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.northlight-images.co.uk/choosing-the-best-paper-for-your-photo-prints/">http://www.northlight-images.co.uk/choosing-the-best-paper-for-your-photo-prints/</a> <br />and video at: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qubh3MiShk8">https://youtu.be/qubh3MiShk8</a>{% endraw %}
