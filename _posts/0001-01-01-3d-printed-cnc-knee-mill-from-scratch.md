It is mostly built out of 3D printed parts and aluminium profiles. I had to do an insane amount of cuts drills and taps on this build but I think the end result is very much worth it.<br />Apart from the XYZ movement it has a lifting XY table that allows for very tall parts to fit in the work area and a tilting head to do weird chamfering and slotting jobs. The motors are Nema23 attached to some ball screws and MGN12 linear guides and blocks.<br />I'm already aware that I should have protected the guides and the ball screws from the chips while milling. I'll try to add some covers in the future.<br />It is way faster cutting through steel than my previous all metal CNC too so I'm pretty sure it'll come in handy for future projects.
