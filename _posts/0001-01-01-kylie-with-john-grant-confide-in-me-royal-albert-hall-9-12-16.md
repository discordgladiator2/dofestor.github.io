{% raw %}This is very special.  Even in amongst all the specialness that is a Kylie Christmas.<br /><br />My all-time favourite Kylie song, which she hasn't performed for a while, brought back into a live show, AND as a duet with one of the best male singer songwriters who also happens to have one of the best male voices around in pop, rock and indie.<br /><br />Was also lucky to see John Grant's show here, 6 months ago, and Kylie joined him for the encore, a wonderful surprise duet on Glacier (see that elsewhere on this channel -   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TudQlSc0JQo">https://youtu.be/TudQlSc0JQo</a> ).  <br />Nice to see them reciprocating{% endraw %}
