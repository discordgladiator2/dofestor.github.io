{% raw %}I restored this upcycled toy car , made from an old wooden coffin plane and vintage Meccano parts. Enjoy the restoration video !!<br /><br />This is a large coffin plane that was been upcycled to create this beautiful roadster car. All other parts are old Meccano parts (wheels, steering wheel, headlights, front bumpers, rear bumper). When I first saw this toy , I realized it needed to be restored because it would be a successful restoration project and because it will be a piece to be placed in my collection. But ended up donating it to a little boy. Anyway, a lot of time has been spent on this restoration video to create a nice video that you'll enjoy to watch. I'm really pleased with the results, the restoration gone perfect and I'm happy. Probably this piece is unique in the world because it is handmade, I would have liked to know more about the time when it was created, the age of the parts from which it was built. <br />I spent almost 4 weeks in this restoration and I spent almost 35 euros in the products that made this restoration to be perfect. <br />I like to make restoration projects, it's my passion and I'm open to hear your opinions in the comment section. Feel free to write what you think.<br /><br />So, guys, thanks for watching and hope you'll enjoyed the restoration! ahhhh, and don't forget to subscribe !! Cheers !!<br /><br />#restoration #meccanorestoration #toyrestoration{% endraw %}
