{% raw %}Listen to TIM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lnk.to/TIMAlbum">https://lnk.to/TIMAlbum</a><br /><br />Tim and Chris Martin wrote and recorded “Heaven” in 2014, with Tim producing the final version in 2016.<br /><br />About the tribute video: My name is Levan Tsikurishvili and I have been working with Tim since about 2013. During these years, we made 8 music videos, 3 concert movies and 2 documentaries together. In 2016, right after his last show, Tim, Tim’s childhood friend Awat, and I spent 19 beautiful days in Madagascar, ll Saint Marie. We spoke about everything, laughed, played monopoly, hung out with lemurs, and explored the entire island together. Now, two-and-a-half years later, I returned to the island to remember Tim, to honor his legacy, and to recreate the memories that will stay with us forever.<br /><br />Note: This video is a collection of my smartphone videos plus some parts of unused material from the documentary Avicii: True Stories and newly shot footage. I also did some 3D animations in order to recreate the moments that I did not have any video material from.<br /><br />Line Producers<br />Francois-Xavier Mayer (Fifou) (2016-2019)<br />Jonathan Waldefeldt (2016)<br />Tomas Kollder (2019)<br />Rouglan Guillaume (2019)<br />Tatiana Brouers (2019)<br /><br />Location Manager (2016-2019)<br />Sergio Botou<br /><br />Driver (2016-2019)<br />Senga Botovangaindrano<br /><br />Coordinators (2016-2019)<br />Florielle Bevahoaka<br />Dina Mampionona<br />A-J Hamilton (2019)<br /><br />D.O.P (2019)<br />Albin Sjödin<br /><br />D.O.P (2016)<br />Levan Tsikurishvili<br /><br />Editor<br />Nils Moström<br /><br />Composing, 3D Animation, Retouching<br />Volodymir Kolisnyk (KPP)<br /><br />Modelling, Texturing<br />Alex Zaremsky<br /><br />VFX Producer<br />Vlada Kiseleva<br /><br />Colourist<br />Olga Korzhinskaya<br /><br />Directed And Produced By <br />Levan Tsikurishvili<br /><br />Management<br />Christopher Thordson<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Step out into the dawn<br />You pray ’til, you pray ’til the lights come on<br />And then you feel like you’ve just been born<br />Yeah, you come to raise me up<br />When I’m beaten and broken up<br />And now I’m back in the arms I love<br /><br />And I think I just died<br />I think I just died<br />Yeah, I think I just died<br />I think I just died<br />And went to heaven<br />(Ooh)<br />And went to heaven<br />(Ooh)<br /><br />Beaten and bathed in blood<br />I'm hit by, I'm hit by your love and drug<br />And now you've come to raise me up<br />(Oh)<br /><br />And I think I just died<br />I think I just died<br />I think I just died<br />Yeah, I think I just died<br />And went to heaven<br />(Ooh)<br />And went to heaven<br />(Ooh)<br />And went to heaven<br /><br />It’s such a night, such a beautiful night<br />It’s such a view, such a beautiful sight<br />I think I just, oh, I think I just died<br />(Ooh)<br />And went to heaven<br />(Ooh)<br />And went to heaven<br />(Ooh)<br />(Oh, yeah)<br />(Ooh)<br />(Yeah)<br /><br />We’re gonna be birds and fly<br />We're gonna set the world alight<br />We’re gonna lose ourselves tonight<br />(Ooh)<br />We’re going be birds and fly<br />We're gonna set the world alight<br />We’re gonna lose ourselves tonight<br />(Ooh)<br /><br />In heaven<br />(Heaven){% endraw %}
