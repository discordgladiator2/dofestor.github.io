{% raw %}Training your booty a lot? ♥︎ you better take those 9 minutes to stretch it! / Werbung<br /><br />Imagine: we always squeeze squeeze &amp; squeeze our butt cheeks… but do we actively help the muscles recover? Most stretching routines focus on hamstrings, thighs, hips and calves. And I agree, it’s super hard to actually lengthen the booty muscles. But in between those leg stretches you will find some booty stretches that feel AMAZING :) <br /><br />PS: the Pretzel looks weird, but it actually hits the booty so nicely haha. I was sore on that day and I could feel it verrrrrry well :) <br /><br />Apart from that, you also  and mind, , .  <br /><br />You can do this routine: <br />- to calm down your entire body<br />- prevent injuries<br />- make sure your body will recover quicker &amp; stay smooth and flexible<br />- if you feel sore, the day after an intense Leg Day <br />- on a daily basis<br />- at the end of your workout session<br />- to wake up in the morning<br />- before you go to bed <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel &amp; in my Pam App. 30min, 45min, Beginner Friendly, 60min, 45min weights &amp; a dance plan.
