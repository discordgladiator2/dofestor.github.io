{% raw %}This video will guide you through the process of assembling an IKEA &quot;MALM&quot; dresser.<br /><br />The assembly is simple but rather lengthy and can be done by a single person without assistance.  You only need a Hammer, and both a Flat Head and Phillips Head Screwdrivers.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTES:<br />- I did not install the safety fasteners for securing the dresser to a wall which is recommend in the manual as I do not have young children and may wish to move the dresser to a different location at some point in the future.<br />- If you expect that young children could use your dresser then you should strongly consider securing your dresser as recommended and as shown in the assembly manual.<br /><br />Good Luck with your assembly.<br /><br />Vito Mike Casola, P.Eng.<br />FIX IT Yourself.{% endraw %}
