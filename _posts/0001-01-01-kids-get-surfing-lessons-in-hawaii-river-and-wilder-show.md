{% raw %}While in Kaua'i Hawaii travelling on family vacation, River and Wilder stop in at Hanalei Bay for Surfing lessons. We'll rent a kids surf board and get surfing tips from a pro. Then the boys travel to Hanalei Bay to learn how to surf the waves. Will they hang 10? or fail, fall, crash and make funny surfing bloopers? River needs surfing lessons, but Wilder's a surfing pro on his first few tries!{% endraw %}
