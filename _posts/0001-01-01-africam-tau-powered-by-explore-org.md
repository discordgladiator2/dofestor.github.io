{% raw %}On the Northern border of South Africa and Botswana lies a beautiful area known as the Groot Marico, named after the Marico River. This spectacular setting houses Tau Game Lodge situated in the Madikwe Game Reserve (the 4th largest game reserve in the country). The lodge overlooks Tau Waterhole,  an oasis for animals and wildlife including elephants, giraffes, lions, tigers, zebras, and cheetahs .<br />Along with these animals this area attracts over 27 species of game and is a prime spot for bird watchers. The waterhole also houses resident nile crocodiles that prey on small game and birds. The Tau live camera gives viewers a secret window into this sanctuary and itâ€™s robust South African ecosystem as elephants bathe, lions roar, wild dogs roam, and crocodiles prey. <br /><br />EXPLORE is the largest live nature cam network on the planet.
