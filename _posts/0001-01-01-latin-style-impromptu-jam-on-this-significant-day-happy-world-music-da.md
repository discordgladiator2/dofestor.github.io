{% raw %}It is just impromptu jamming with a Latin groove. Latin music is one of my favorites zoner in music. Carlos Santana,AL de meola.Paco de Lucia etc those legends are my all-time heroes. In this video, I try to express myself as much as in Latin style. If this small video carries a little smile on you that will be my success for sharing it.
