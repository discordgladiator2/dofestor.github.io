The group takes its name from the Italian word for invention: the art of spontaneously developing independent melodic lines that, combined together, create a living musical whole. l’Invenzione aims to evoke fantasy, emotions and nature by traveling along uncharted paths of music. While rarely heard today, these pieces are true master works. l'Invenzione's performances have drawn on the wonderfully rich music of 17th and 18th Century Naples, the undisputed “capital of the musical world” of that time. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.linvenzione.com">http://www.linvenzione.com</a>{% endraw %}
