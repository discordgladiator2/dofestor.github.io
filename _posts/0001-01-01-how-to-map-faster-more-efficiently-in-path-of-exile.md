{% raw %}Anyone can map faster and more efficiently.<br />You don't need expensive items or to complete maps in what is objectively the fastest time. By tweaking your Loot Filter you can increase your mapping speed an mapping efficiency. I know it might seem a little counter-intuitive that you make more currency by picking up less items, and it might seem like your map feels empty or you're not making any currency. But remember if you complete maps faster and kill enemies faster that's more big ticket drops that are going to happen naturally over time. More divine orbs, more exalted orbs and all of this scales exponentially with investment.<br /><br />I stream weekly at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/tenkiei">https://www.twitch.tv/tenkiei</a><br /><br />My PoE Profile is: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Tenkiei/characters">https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Tenkiei/characters</a><br /><br />Customize your loot filter here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filterblade.xyz/">https://filterblade.xyz/</a><br /><br />0:00 - Introduction<br />1:56 - Alched Map Strict<br />3:39 - Alched Map Uber Strict<br />5:00 - Alched Map Comparison<br />7:00 - High Investment Map<br />8:53 - Time Comparison<br />9:22 - Loot Comparison<br />11:15 - Loot (Simplified)<br />12:30 - Closing Thoughts<br /><br />Music: Barrel Full of Sea Monkeys by The Whole Other<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfzyJ-HvEZbGmubAmfcsfQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfzyJ-HvEZbGmubAmfcsfQ</a><br /><br />Music Provided from the Youtube Music Audio Library{% endraw %}
