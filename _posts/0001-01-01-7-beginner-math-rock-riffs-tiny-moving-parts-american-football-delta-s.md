{% raw %}Hey, Steve here. In this video, I carefully selected 7 guitar riffs I believe are useful for beginners, and for those new to math rock. By learning some of, or all of these riffs you'll pick up on useful chord shapes for math rock, guitar techniques that are often used in math rock, and through osmosis, you'll learn how riffs can be written, and how angular melodies are formed.<br /><br />Tabs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://letstalkaboutmathrock.com/7-beginner-math-rock-riffs/">http://letstalkaboutmathrock.com/7-beginner-math-rock-riffs/</a><br /> <br />Looking to support the channel?
