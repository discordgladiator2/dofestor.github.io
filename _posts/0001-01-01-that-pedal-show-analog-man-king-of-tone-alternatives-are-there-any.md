It’s Dan’s favourite overdrive of recent times but as many people will know, there is a very long waiting list if you want to buy one.<br /><br />So, what can you do while you’re waiting, or indeed if you don’t want to wait at all? We’ve selected six other overdrives that do a similar job and set about 50 minutes of comparing them to the KOT. <br />We chose these pedals because we have experience of them / have them to hand. There are of course others, but we need to keep things manageable! <br /><br /><br />Here are some timings to help you navigate this long video…<br /><br />KOT intro, background &amp; explanation 2:44<br /><br />KOT sound demo 8.00 - 11:00<br /><br />“Todays pedals are…” 11:45<br /><br />Lovepedal Amp Eleven (from 12:35)<br /><br />Tone City King Of Blues (from 19:10)<br />Thanks to Andertons Music for lending us this and the Full-Drive 3 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.andertons.co.uk/overdrive-pedals/pid41692/cid802/tone-city-king-of-blues-overdrive-pedal.asp">http://www.andertons.co.uk/overdrive-pedals/pid41692/cid802/tone-city-king-of-blues-overdrive-pedal.asp</a><br /><br />Fulltone Full-Drive 3 (from 21:53)<br /><br />T-Rex Møller 2 (from 28:28)<br /><br />J Rockett Tim Pierce Signature (from 32:32) The GoPro pedal cam dies part way through – sorry! <br /><br />Lazy J Cruiser Deuce (from 35:37)<br /><br />“Is there a pedal that sounds exactly like the King Of Tone?” (from 39:36)<br /><br />Fun with the Gretsch 6118T-LIV Players Edition Anniversary and all the pedals (from 42:54, playing at 44:13)<br />And yes, Mick says “Brigsby”. Sorry about that. <br /><br /><br />In this video, Mick is playing his Fender American Vintage ’62 Stratocaster. Daniel is playing his Gibson Custom 1958 Les Paul Standard and a Gretsch 6118T-LIV Players Edition Anniversary.<br /><br />Amps are a Fender Super Reverb reissue with 4x10-inch Jensen P10R speakers and a Mallard 18-watt Marshall clone on a Marshall 2061cx 2x12 cab with Celestion G12H Anniversary speakers. Both amps are running all the time.<br /><br />As always, all pedal and amp switching and routing is handled by TheGigRig G2. <br />For more on TheGigRig see www.thegigrig.com<br /><br />If you like what we do and could use an extra garment of super stylish and practical clothing, please buy a T-shirt! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thatpedalshowstore.com/">http://www.thatpedalshowstore.com/</a>{% endraw %}
