{% raw %}Using High Frequency Accelerometer and Mouse to Compensate for End-to-end Latency in Indirect Interaction<br />Axel Antoine, Sylvain Malacria, GÃ©ry Casiez<br /><br />CHI '18: ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems<br />Session: Touch, Pen, and Mice<br /><br />Abstract<br />End-to-end latency corresponds to the temporal difference between a user input and the corresponding output from a system. It has been shown to degrade user performance in both direct and indirect interaction. If it can be reduced to some extend, latency can also be compensated through software compensation by trying to predict the future position of the cursor based on previous positions, velocities and accelerations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hardware and software prediction technique specifically designed for partially compensating end-to-end latency in indirect pointing. We combine a computer mouse with a high frequency accelerometer to predict the future location of the pointer using Euler based equations. Our prediction method results in more accurate prediction than previously introduced prediction algorithms for direct touch. A controlled experiment also revealed that it can improve target acquisition time in pointing tasks.<br /><br />DOI: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174183">https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174183</a><br />WEB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chi2018.acm.org/">https://chi2018.acm.org/</a>{% endraw %}
