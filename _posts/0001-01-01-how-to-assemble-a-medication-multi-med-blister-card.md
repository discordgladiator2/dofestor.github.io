{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.medicationpackagingsolutions.com">http://www.medicationpackagingsolutions.com</a>  These multi-med blister cards are quick and easy to assemble and fill with your medications. <br /><br />This video will show you the steps to filling your own multi-med blister cards at home. It can be confusing for some patients who take several medications each day and at different times of the day.  With these cards, you, a pharmacist or a caregiver will be able to easily setup your medications to take in the morning, noon, evening or at night. <br /><br />Each filled card has your 7 day supply of medications, and at the end of the week you’ll be able to throw that card away.  You’ll then use a fresh, clean and disposable multi-med card for the next week.  You can even fill a few weeks supply of cards at one time, which is convenient and saves you time. <br /><br />Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.medicationpackagingsolutions.com">http://www.medicationpackagingsolutions.com</a> to learn more and to get your pill box cards.{% endraw %}
