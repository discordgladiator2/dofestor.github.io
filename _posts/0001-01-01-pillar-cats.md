{% raw %}Yes, it's a Bongo Cat meme. A friend asked me to make one. I spent too much time on it to just send it to him, so I put it here. Maybe now I can reach a Japanese audience too! Mwahahaha!     <br /><br />pls no copyright strike and pls don't judge me...<br /><br />Also I was too lazy with the &quot;menacing&quot; part at the end, so credit for that goes to: IbuprophenWithPH (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/IbuprofenwithPH)">https://twitter.com/IbuprofenwithPH)</a><br />Here's his video if you want to use it: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJF7GNBk4rM&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJF7GNBk4rM&amp;t=3s</a>{% endraw %}
