{% raw %}Whenever Sacramento SPCA has a dog for me to foster I'm always immediately on board. Only this time was a little different...<br /><br />Stella was very sick and I wasn't sure I could handle it. I reluctantly headed over to pick up Kai (came back with PomPoms too) and the rest is history. This was one of the most complex, difficult and beautiful times of my life. I learned so much. I want to share the ups and downs of what it's like to devote your life to saving these animals. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
