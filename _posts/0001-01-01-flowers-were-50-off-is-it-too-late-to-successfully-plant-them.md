{% raw %}Today I scored a great deal on flowers at 50% off their regular price because it's so late in the season.  With a little tender loving care they should perform just fine for me this summer.<br /><br />S H O P   T H I S   V I D E O<br />The Unkillable Kitty O'Kane   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hpQBiP">https://amzn.to/3hpQBiP</a><br />Farm to Trouble   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hdwExb">https://amzn.to/3hdwExb</a><br />Tiger Bloom   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ybUDCw">https://amzn.to/3ybUDCw</a><br /><br />COOKBOOKS ARE BACK IN STOCK.

I just started and my first big fat check was $14.40 and I could not be happier about it.  I'm building my next big fat check - so far it's $28.34.  It's super easy and I am pleasantly surprised by how many of the places I shop are affiliated with eBates.  Amazon?  Walmart?  Tractor Supply?  Kohls?  They're all there waiting to give me (and you) a couple dollars back on our orders.

I'm Jennifer, a forty-something wife and mother of 7 children ages 7 - 23.  We are Catholic.  We homeschool.  We cook from scratch.  We farm cranberries.  We drink coffee.  We advocate for Down syndrome awareness.  We are loud.  We are chaotic.<br /><br />Here I'll share vlogs about all these things, what I'm doing that works and what I've tried but didn't work.  I hope to encourage you in your journey through motherhood, homeschooling, learning to cook, and growing in your faith through it all.<br /><br />Business Inquiries OR Collaborations  cranmomof7@gmail.com<br /><br />For written blogs you can find me at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://camphomeschool.blogspot.com/">https://camphomeschool.blogspot.com/</a><br /><br />Instagram  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/acountry_life/">https://www.instagram.com/acountry_life/</a><br /><br />Facebook  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/camphomeschool/">https://www.facebook.com/camphomeschool/</a><br /><br />This post contains affiliate links.
