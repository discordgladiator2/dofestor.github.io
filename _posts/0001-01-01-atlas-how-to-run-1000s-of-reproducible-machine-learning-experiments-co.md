{% raw %}Download Atlas for free and use it for any of your Python machine learning development projects: www.atlas.dessa.com <br /><br />And don't forget to check Atlas out on Product Hunt, we'd love to hear your feedback!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/foundations-atlas">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/foundations-atlas</a><br /><br />You can also get help for your machine learning projects by chatting with our Engineering team on our Community Slack channel: www.tiny.cc/dessa<br />------------<br />In this video, our Technical Product Manager Cole gives the lowdown on how our product Atlas helps machine learning practitioners:<br />+ Organize modelling workflows<br />+ Track the input and output of every experiment<br />+Archive every experiment to ensure reproducibility<br />+ Submit 100s of jobs to a queue to run on available resources<br />+ Visualize information about their models<br />+ Seamlessly take advantage of Tensorboard from within Atlas<br />+ Save $$$ using pre-emptive GPUs and the rescheduling of jobs{% endraw %}
