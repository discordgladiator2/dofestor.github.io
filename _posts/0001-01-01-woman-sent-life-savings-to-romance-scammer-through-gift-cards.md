{% raw %}On this episode of Scamfish, we helped a woman named Shellie who was dating three different men online. She was suspicious about the three men being scammers and we stepped in to verify their identities. While talking to one of the men claiming to be named Robert, she received several envelopes of cash from a third party. She would buy gift cards and Bitcoin with this cash then send this currency back to Robert. She met these men on Zoosk and Facebook dating, and we ended up tracking one of them to Lagos, Nigeria. We found that all three of the profiles were fake using our tools on SocialCatfish.com. Want to learn more?
