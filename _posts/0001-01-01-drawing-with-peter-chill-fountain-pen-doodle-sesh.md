No pressure. We can draw anything or nothing, and if it doesn't turn out great, that's ok. The goal is to just make something that wasn't there before. That's a good feeling. And to feel the tip of the pen go across the surface of the paper and see the lines appear there, I like that too. Very satisfying.<br /><br />I call this style &quot;endless&quot; because you can see how I struggled to stop at the end, and you really can go on forever. Some people don't prefer it since it's not very representational, but that's one of the things about it that appeals to me.<br /><br />I apologize if the camera was a little shaky today, I'll try to make it more steady in the future.<br /><br />My new book Dayfever: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WWIFuK">https://amzn.to/2WWIFuK</a><br />The rest of my books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00HVOQ27S">https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00HVOQ27S</a><br /><br />Instagram........... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/peterdraws/">https://www.instagram.com/peterdraws/</a><br />Twitter................. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PeterDraws1">https://twitter.com/PeterDraws1</a><br />Patreon............... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/peterdraws">https://www.patreon.com/peterdraws</a><br />Twitch................. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/peterdraws">https://www.twitch.tv/peterdraws</a><br /><br />My Website......... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.peterdraws.com/">https://www.peterdraws.com/</a><br />Email................... peter@peterdraws.com{% endraw %}
