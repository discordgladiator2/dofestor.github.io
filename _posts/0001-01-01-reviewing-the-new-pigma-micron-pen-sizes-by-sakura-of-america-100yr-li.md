{% raw %}Pigma Micron released 2 new sizes - they now come in 10 (0.60mm) and 1.2 (0.70mm) - such thick and beautiful pen nibs! Pigma Micron are Sakura of America's ink liner pens. Thank you Sakura of America for sending me these parcels and always keeping me stocked with my most used art supplies! I was also sent their 100-year anniversary limited-edition set! In this video I unbox both parcels, try out the pens and give you my review.<br /><br />✷✷✷<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE<br />For art &amp; art-business content.
