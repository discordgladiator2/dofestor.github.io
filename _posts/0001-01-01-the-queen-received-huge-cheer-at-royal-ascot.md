{% raw %}Her Majesty The Queen arrived on the final day of Royal Ascot 2021 among huge cheers and applaud. Royal Ascot is a British racecourse, located in Ascot, Berkshire, England, which is used for thoroughbred horse racing. It is one of the leading racecourses in the United Kingdom, hosting 13 of Britain’s 36 annual Group 1 horse races. As Britain’s most valuable race meeting, attracting many of the world’s finest racehorses to compete for millions of pounds in prize money, Royal Ascot is anticipated and revered the world over. Ascot Racecourse was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 and has since received the patronage of a further eleven monarchs. The first race, “Her Majesty’s Plate”, with a purse of 100 guineas in which seven horses competed. The Ascot summer race meeting officially became a Royal week in 1911. The Queen is the owner and breeder of many thoroughbred horses and shares her interest in horses with many members of her family. In fact, The Queen’s own horses have won races at Royal Ascot a number of times. The names of the week’s races have a Royal theme, such as ‘King George V Stakes’, ‘Diamond Jubilee Stakes’ and ‘Windsor Castle Stakes’. Queen Elizabeth attended the Races for the first time in 1945.<br /><br /><br /><br />Usually, The Queen attends The Royal Ascot on the first four days with various members of the Royal Family joining her. But since 1945, this year was the first time when The Queen attended it on the last day as she had other official engagements on the other days.<br /><br /><br />Another tidbit from today's appearance is that The Queen was wearing exactly the same outfit that she wore at the wedding of her granddaughter Princess Beatrice in 2020.<br /><br /><br />Video Courtesy: Royal Ascot Facebook Page{% endraw %}
