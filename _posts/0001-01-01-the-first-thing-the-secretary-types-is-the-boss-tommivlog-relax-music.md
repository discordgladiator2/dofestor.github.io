{% raw %}Welcome to Tommi Vlog Channel, I am a full-time healing music composer. And I love chinese traditional music.<br /><br />As you know music therapy can reduce stress and promote relaxation. Itâ€™s been shown to be more effective than prescription drugs in reducing anxiety levels before surgery. A study published in 2017 found that a 30-minute music therapy session combined with traditional care after spinal surgery reduced pain.<br /><br />Thank you very much for listening and for leaving feedback. Every single day I am completely astonished by all your warm support and it really inspires me to work even harder on my music. <br /><br />Music composed/arranged by Steve .D. Satya. <br /><br />#tommivlogmusic #tommivloghealingmusic #TommiVlogRelaxMusicForSleep #TommiVlog #RelaxMusicForSleep{% endraw %}
