That means, you may choose up to 6 study programs from same or different universities and add to your shortlist, then you can access to your shortlist and apply from there. You should rank your study program choice wisely because once you submit your application, then you wonâ€™t be able to change it.<br /><br />And in Separate application system, you can apply directly apply through the universityâ€™s webpage or studyinfo.com. You even can make applications for as many subjects as you like through submitting separate application form. <br /><br />Requirements and documents: When you fill the application form, upload all of the required documents they asked for including your IELTS or SAT and all academic documents. <br /><br />By the way, some universities require the photocopy of the applicantâ€™s documentation and on that case, you need to send the required documents by DHL or other mail services to the university before the deadline. <br /><br />The decision of the university: After checking the all applications very carefully, universities will send you an email if you have selected primarily. Some universities ask to send them a motivational video and most of the universities ask to attend an exam on General math, IQ test, Analytical question and Subject based questionnaire (we will discuss about exam in another video). The result of the exam usually publishes in a month and notify the applicants by sending email or mail.<br /><br />Music: &quot;Royalty Free Music from Bensound&quot;<br /><br />#studyinfinland #howtoapplyinfinland #howtostudyinfinland #howtogetadmissioninfinland #studyfinland{% endraw %}
