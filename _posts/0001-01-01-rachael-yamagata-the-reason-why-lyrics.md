{% raw %}LYRICS ARE HERE! Please comment!<br /><br /><br /><br />I think about how it might have been<br /><br />We'd spend out days travelin'<br /><br />It's not that I don't understand you<br /><br />It's not that I don't want to be with you<br /><br />But you only wanted me<br /><br />The way you wanted me<br /><br /><br /><br />So, I will head out alone, hope for the best<br /><br />And we hang our heads down<br /><br />As we skip the goodbyes<br /><br />And you can tell the world what you want them to hear<br /><br />I've got nothing left to lose, my dear<br /><br />So, I'm up for the little white lies<br /><br />But you and I know the reason why<br /><br />I'm gone, and you're still there<br /><br />I'm gone, and you're still there<br /><br />I'm gone, and you're still there<br /><br /><br /><br />I'll buy a magazine searching for your face<br /><br />From coast to coast, or where ever I find my place<br /><br />I'll track you on the radio, and<br /><br />I'll find your list in a different name<br /><br />But as close as I get to you<br /><br />It's not the same<br /><br /><br /><br />So, I will head out alone, hope for the best<br /><br />We can pat ourselves on the back<br /><br />As say that we tried<br /><br />And if one of us makes it big<br /><br />We can spill our regrets<br /><br />And talk about how the love never dies<br /><br />But you and I know the reason why<br /><br />I'm gone, you're still there<br /><br />I'm gone, you're still there<br /><br />I'm gone, and you're still there<br /><br /><br /><br />So, steal the show, and do your best<br /><br />To cover the tracks that I have left<br /><br />I wish you well and hope you find<br /><br />Whatever you're looking for<br /><br />The way I might've changed my mind,<br /><br />But you only showed me the door<br /><br /><br /><br />So, I will head out alone, hope for the best<br /><br />We can pat ourselves on the back<br /><br />And say that we tried<br /><br />And if one of us makes it big<br /><br />We can spill our regrets<br /><br />And talk about how the love never dies<br /><br />But you and I, you and I, you and I know the reason why.{% endraw %}
