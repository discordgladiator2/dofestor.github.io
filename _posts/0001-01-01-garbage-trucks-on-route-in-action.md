{% raw %}Some of my most popular videos have always been longer, compilation-style videos featuring several different garbage trucks. I often receive messages from parents of young garbage truck fans, telling me that their little ones are huge fans of these longer videos and are fascinated by the variety of different garbage trucks...<br /><br />...So by popular demand, here is another garbage truck compilation video! This video features a wide variety of all different kinds of garbage trucks, all doing what they do best: picking up trash! You'll see rear loaders, side loaders, front loaders, automated trucks, and even a couple of curb-sort recycle trucks! This video will be sure to keep everyone entertained, from the youngest garbage trucks fans, to fellow adult garbage truck enthusiasts like myself, there's plenty of action! For those who regularly follow my videos, you'll even see a few new trucks that haven't had their &quot;feature video&quot; uploaded yet!<br /><br />Want to see more garbage trucks in action? Be sure to check out my channel and subscribe!<br /><br />Thanks for watching! I hope you all enjoyed! Feel free to leave comments and questions!<br /><br />I would also like to extend a huge thank you to all of the drivers of the trucks featured in this video!<br /><br />Thrash 'N' Trash Productions...Wasting Away Through Garbage Trucks and Heavy Metal Since 2008<br /><br />For more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/TrashMonkey22">http://www.youtube.com/TrashMonkey22</a><br />For more photos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/deathmetal22">http://www.flickr.com/deathmetal22</a><br />For my latest musings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/ThrashNTrashProductions">http://www.facebook.com/ThrashNTrashProductions</a><br />For my garbage truck blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://wastedwashington.blogspot.com/">http://wastedwashington.blogspot.com/</a><br />For refuse industry history: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.classicrefusetrucks.com/">http://www.classicrefusetrucks.com/</a><br /><br />Thanks for Watching!<br /><br />Â©2015 Thrash 'N' Trash Productions.
