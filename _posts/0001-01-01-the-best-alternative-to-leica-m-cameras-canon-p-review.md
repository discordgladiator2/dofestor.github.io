{% raw %}The BEST Alternative To Leica M Cameras | Canon P Review<br />Today I'm going to be giving you my review of the best alternative to Leica M cameras. The Canon P. I've been shooting with the Canon P for about a year and a half now and I have to say it is one of the most well built and well designed cameras I've ever used. I have taken this camera all over the United States with me and its durability is absolutely tank like. The Canon P is a much more affordable rangefinder than its Leica, Zeiss Contax, or even Nikon counterparts. If you are looking for a 35mm rangefinder camera and you can live with LTM lenses instead of Leica M Mount lenses, then the Canon P is probably your best option! I hope you found my review of the Canon P useful and entertaining. Make sure to SUBSCRIBE for future videos!
