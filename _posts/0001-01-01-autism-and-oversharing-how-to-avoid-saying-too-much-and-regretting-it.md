That's exactly why I started this blog, because if I didn't show you, you would never know.<br /><br />As the name suggests, this channel is devoted to giving you insight into the world of Aspergers.<br />This blog started off being just my story, but I've learned SO MUCH about my own condition<br />from meeting others on the Autism Spectrum that now I make sure to feature their stories as well.<br /><br />I've come a long way in my own personal journey.<br />Now I'm sharing what I've found so you don't have to learn it the hard way too.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />// WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS BLOG<br /><br />You can expect me to get to the point with concise useful information.<br />I focus on what is most important and don't shy away from difficult topics.<br /><br />The best way to learn about Autism is to see it in real life ( i.e. via the stories of many, many people on the spectrum).<br /><br />In this channel I endeavour to show you what Autism and Aspergers look like in real people and to also give you some insight as to what's happening on the inside.<br />I upload a new video every weekend with some bonus content thrown in mid-week too.<br />There's always new stuff coming through so be sure to check back and see what you've missed. (Is this where I'm supposed to tell you to hit that subscribe button?)<br /><br />Topics Include:<br />- What is Aspergers/Autism?<br />- Aspie Tips, coping strategies, and advice on common issues<br />- Learning Emotional Intelligence (this is my special interest!)<br />- Autism in real life: stories from special guests<br /><br />Everything I do is and endeavour to go deeper and take you 'behind the scenes' to understand what may, at first glance, seem 'odd'.<br />oh, and I love busting stereotypes and turning preconceptions upsidedown :)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />// ABOUT ME<br /><br />I discovered I have aspergers at the age of thrity.<br />It has been my life's mission to understand these funny creatures we call humans.<br />My special interest is a combination of emotional intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, thinking styles, behaviour, and motivation. (I.e. what makes people tick)<br />My background is in engineering and I see the world in systems to be analysed.<br />My passion is for taking the incredibly complex, deciphering the pattern, and explaining it very simply.<br />My philosophy is that blogging is an adventure best shared.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />// EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING<br /><br />I also run autism friendly online emotional intelligence training.
