{% raw %}In this one, I finally do a proper collaboration with my friend @Kamp Kenan ! A few weeks back, I texted him that I would be in Floride soon. He immediately gave me a call and one thing led to another. We decided that this was the perfect chance to finally do a build together.<br /><br />He thought it made sense to do a build for his young Black Throated Monitor Lizard. We didn't have much time though. I only had a few days to make the background at home and have them shipped. See what we came up within just a few days time!<br /><br />Kenan's Video - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jkNxtPtRtbI">https://youtu.be/jkNxtPtRtbI</a><br /><br />Buy Merch- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/serpadesign">https://teespring.com/stores/serpadesign</a><br /><br /><br />Follow SerpaDesign<br />Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/serpadesign/">https://www.instagram.com/serpadesign/</a><br />TikTok- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@serpadesign">https://www.tiktok.com/@serpadesign</a><br />Second Channel- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/tannerserpa">https://www.youtube.com/tannerserpa</a><br /><br />#lizard #vivarium #serpadesign{% endraw %}
