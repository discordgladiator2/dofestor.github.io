{% raw %}Will Evie's Father Make An Appearance In Descendants 4...Find Out! <br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things</a><br /><br />The past three Descendants films have given us plot twist after plot twist, and fans have taken it all in stride. However, one question the films have failed to answer through these plot twists is who exactly the main character Evieâ€™s father is. <br /><br />While the third film gave us the shocking reveal that Mal was the daughter of not only Maleficent but iconic character Hades as well, we still have no info on her gal pal Evie. In this video weâ€™ll delve deep into the depths of the films easter eggs, fandom theories, and potential future storylines and might just have the answers youâ€™ve been looking for and Disney has been hiding. <br /><br />Are Mal and Evie half sisters? Could Beauty and the Beastâ€™s vain Gaston be her father? Weâ€™re dissecting why exactly the Evil Queen was so obsessed with Evie finding a husband when she didnâ€™t have one herself. Letâ€™s just say all these theories would definitely make her storyline slightly more...juicy and drama filled. <br /><br />Do you think weâ€™ll be getting a Descendants part 4 that will answer all of our questions? What if Evieâ€™s father isnâ€™t a villain? What if heâ€™s a hero?  Let us know all your magical opinions in the comment section below. In the meantime, weâ€™re keeping all our fingers and toes crossed for part four. Donâ€™t forget to hit that subscribe button and give this video a thumbs up. Have a magical day! <br /><br /><br />Throwbacks ðŸ¤ªðŸ”™ | TheThings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgwC1iDMKe1hEfcWYOvky8qSZaC1z0r23">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgwC1iDMKe1hEfcWYOvky8qSZaC1z0r23</a> <br /><br />âœ¨DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC âœ¨ | Potterheads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgwC1iDMKe1iN_AtQg5_oCcJcM7EYU-lJ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgwC1iDMKe1iN_AtQg5_oCcJcM7EYU-lJ</a><br /><br />DISNEY CLASSICS ðŸ‘¸ðŸ’– | TheThings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgwC1iDMKe1jJhIyEiPkGpXUwxQvkEtvv">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgwC1iDMKe1jJhIyEiPkGpXUwxQvkEtvv</a> <br /><br />NEW UPLOADS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheThings/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=2">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheThings/videos?view=0&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=2</a> <br /><br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />Written by: Alyssa Goulart<br />Narrated by: Grant Kellett @Gtalkstoomuch<br />Edited by: V.Serhii<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
