{% raw %}Worship By Myself is not just a song but a message sent to all believers and those who are yet to receive Christ. It tells of the sacrifice of Jesus and the necessity for the Saints not to trivialize their spiritual worship. <br />A line for thought in the song says...  THERE IS NO ONE THAT CAN WORSHIP GOD FOR ME,  I CAME MYSELF TO WORSHIP BY MYSELF. <br /><br />The song calls deeply to our innermost being and entreats our consciousness to submit to God. All have heard it have loved it. You will surely love to listen to this song over and over. It was recorded by JUDAH Precious{% endraw %}
