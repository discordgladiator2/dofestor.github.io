{% raw %}I'm making a late night driver for some high desert fishing on one of oregon's premiere trout fishing rivers. The forecast calls for a 115 degree day so my plan is to make the late night drive while it's cool out, sleep in my rig for a couple hours and then start fishing at first light and fish throughout the day, targeting native trout / redband trout from the river.<br />This was definitely one of my best fishing trips so far. It was a fun adventure, great experience and the trout fishing was nothing to complain about.<br />I started out the morning with some quick catches and things never slowed down from there.. Throughout the day i make my way up the canyon targeting different sections of the Deschutes River (for those who read the description section) fishing fast water, slow water, deep water, shallow water, etc. i fished it all. <br />I did bring my fly fishing rod with me but the windy conditions kept me from pulling it out of my rig, and considering the hot temperatures, i assumed that the trout would be holding a bit lower in the water or in those fast sections where the water tumbles over the boulders giving trout a good spot to get cover as well as take advantage of the re-oxygenated water, so the spin rod setup with rooster tails were the ticket for catching...I was amazed to have had such a good day of fishing considering. When it comes to oregon fishing for trout, especially native trout, this has been my go-to river for years. I never keep fish from this river and always practice catch and release here, as do many others. This river does have some different fishing regulations when it comes to size and limits so make sure to check those regs before heading out. <br />THIS RIVER IS HIGHLY PATROLLED! check out the ODFW website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://myodfw.com">https://myodfw.com</a> <br /><br />For those of you who are unfamiliar with &quot;Redband&quot; Trout, they are a subspecies of Rainbow trout which have adapted to the warmer waters of central oregon rivers. They have a more unique color to them (Rosy Color) and darker and more prominent spotting. The ARE different than the Rainbow trout that you find stocked in ponds and lakes. Good chances are, if you are catching trout in a river/stream east of the cascades, you are catching a redband trout.<br /><br />Gear Used:<br /><br />Fishing Rod - Okuma Celilo 9'6&quot; ML<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dAVSmJ">https://amzn.to/3dAVSmJ</a><br /><br />Reel - Shakespeare GX230<br /><br />Trout Lures - Worden's Rooster Tail 1/6oz (Yakima Bait)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3yf38g8">https://amzn.to/3yf38g8</a><br /><br />Pants - Columbia Omni-Shade Convertible Pants<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ye1RWx">https://amzn.to/3ye1RWx</a><br /><br />Shirt - 511 Tactical <br /><br />CHECK OUT THE Angling Addicts PNW website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.anglingaddictspnw.com">https://www.anglingaddictspnw.com</a>{% endraw %}
