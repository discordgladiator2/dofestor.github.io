{% raw %}In Persist, Elizabeth Warren writes about six perspectives that have influenced her life and advocacy. She's a mother who learned from wrenching personal experience why child care is so essential. She's a teacher who has known since grade school the value of a good and affordable education. She's a planner who understands that every complex problem requires a comprehensive response. She's a fighter who discovered the hard way that nobody gives up power willingly. She's a learner who thinks, listens, and works to fight racism in America. And she's a woman who has proven over and over that women are just as capable as men.<br /><br />Candid and compelling, Persist is both a deeply personal book and a powerful call to action. Elizabeth Warren—one of our nation's most visionary leaders—will inspire everyone to believe that if we're willing to fight for it, profound change is well within our reach.<br /><br />Purchase Book Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9781250799241">https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9781250799241</a><br /><br />Stacey Abrams is the two-time New York Times bestselling author of Our Time Is Now and Lead from the Outside, an entrepreneur, and a political leader.

She is the founder of Fair Fight, Fair Count, and the Southern Economic Advancement Project. Abrams is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations and sits on the advisory board of Climate Power 2020 and the advocacy board of the Women's National Basketball Players Association.
