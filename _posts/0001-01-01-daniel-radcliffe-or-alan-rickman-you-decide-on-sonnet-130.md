{% raw %}A comparison of Daniel's and Alan's interpretations of William Shakespeare's Sonnet 130. Does age and experience tell a different story to the exuberance of youth?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />No copyright infringement intended. Daniel's recisitation was for Valentine's Day 2010, Alan's for the CD compilation &quot;When Love Speaks&quot; from a few years ago.  Photos belong to the takers.{% endraw %}
