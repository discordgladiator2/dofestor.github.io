{% raw %}Where do software bugs come from? What does ‚Äòquality‚Äô mean when we talk about quality code or quality systems? How do we create code with high quality? High-quality software is easier to work on, nicer to use, more flexible in use, more robust under stress, more secure, easier to change as we learn more, and more fun to work on, but how do we achieve it?<br /><br />In this episode, Dave Farley, expert in Continuous Delivery, DevOps and Software engineering in general, describes what high-quality in software really means, and the ideas that we need to focus on to achieve it. He then describes how best to organise the responsibilities in software development teams to achieve the high-quality outcomes that high-end software development and best practices for software can deliver.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />üéì CD TRAINING COURSES üéì<br />If you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DFTraining">https://bit.ly/DFTraining</a><br /><br />'GET GOING WITH CONTINUOUS DELIVERY PIPELINES' COURSE<br />A great way to truly learn the fundamental ideas of Continuous Delivery &amp; DevOps for just ¬£99!
