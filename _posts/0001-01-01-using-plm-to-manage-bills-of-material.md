{% raw %}While Product Data Management (PDM) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) are often discussed as two different business applications, the different concepts they describe are really part of a single, holistic approach to managing information and processes. That said, it's useful to understand those concepts and capabilities, and how implementing them can help your business. <br /><br />In this third of a five-part series introducing the concepts of PLM we'll discuss Bills of Material (BOMs).  BOMs are the primary vehicle for describing a product.  They typically serve as the foundation for various fundamental business processes, which makes their proper management vital.  Topics that will be covered in this webcast are:  <br /><br />-How you can configure, manage, and share BOMs across the organization<br /><br />-Comparing BOMs to facilitate the change process<br /><br />-Incorporating suppliers and customers directly into your processes<br /><br />-Managing supplier qualifications and approved parts (AML/AVL)<br /><br />-Releasing BOMs and design information to manufacturing{% endraw %}
