{% raw %}Get your copy of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; here (Download/Stream/Vinyl/CD): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Royalston.lnk.to/PopularMechanicsym">https://Royalston.lnk.to/PopularMechanicsym</a><br /><br />Australian audio architect Royalston has returned to Med School for his third album ‘Popular Mechanics’. Constantly pushing sonic barriers, this LP sees experimental drum &amp; bass and electronica in its most exciting form. A 14-track delectation boasts cutting edge technical prowess balanced with a rich bouquet of musical grace. This combination of Royalston’s engineering expertise and musical pedigree renders an all-encompassing fusion of everything that makes drum &amp; bass great.<br /> <br />‘What We Were Told’ ft ‘Amy Kisnorb’ is your staple drum &amp; bass roller, in overdrive. It’s a twofold bass attack featuring wobbles and growls balanced with Amy’s angelic vocals. This track will be causing carnage in clubs and warehouses across the land with it’s constant evolution and high energy throughout.<br /> <br />Title track ‘Popular Mechanics’ is everything we love about Royalston. A trio of transformation; beginning gently with an uplifting melody which morphs into deeper techier terrain then reaching its climax with a finale of mind warping bass crunches.<br /> <br />Taking things back, Royalston explores a more traditional landscape in the form of ‘Strobes’. With customarily blissful vocals, this track is vintage Med School. Perfectly soulful, flawless and refined, it’s as smooth as butter. A genuinely marvelous specimen of pure splendor and elegance that remains accessible to all musical tribes.<br /><br />Follow Royalston:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Royalstonmusic/">https://www.facebook.com/Royalstonmusic/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Royalston">https://twitter.com/Royalston</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/royalston/">https://www.instagram.com/royalston/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/royalston">https://soundcloud.com/royalston</a><br /><br />Follow Med School:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.medschoolmusic.com/">http://www.medschoolmusic.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/medschoolmusic">https://soundcloud.com/medschoolmusic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/medschoolmusic">https://www.facebook.com/medschoolmusic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MedSchoolMusic">https://twitter.com/MedSchoolMusic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://open.spotify.com/user/med_school">http://open.spotify.com/user/med_school</a>{% endraw %}
