{% raw %}Some of the small steps we take to live self sufficiently and with zero waste bring so much meaning to our lives. They help us on our journey to regenerate the land and repair it for generations to come. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/motherthemountain">https://www.patreon.com/motherthemountain</a><br /><br />Join us for a typical day on the farm, where we care for the animals, harvest and preserve abundant fruit, and work hard planting, fixing and building.<br /><br /><br />We live and farm on the land of the Arakwal and Minjungbal people of the Bundjalung Nation and these practices of regenerative living, agriculture and permaculture owe their roots and theories to Indigenous knowledge â€” they have been practiced by Indigenous People around the world for so many years. We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the Country we live on, and recognise their continuing connection to the land and waters. We thank them for protecting this rainforest and its ecosystems since time immemorial.<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/motherthemountain/">https://www.instagram.com/motherthemountain/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MotherTheMountainFarm/">https://www.facebook.com/MotherTheMountainFarm/</a><br />Anastasia's Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/anast.asia/">https://www.instagram.com/anast.asia/</a><br />Julia's Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/juliavanderbyl/">https://www.instagram.com/juliavanderbyl/</a><br /><br /><br />Music by Ruby Rodgers: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ruby-rodgers-620624932">https://soundcloud.com/ruby-rodgers-620624932</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mothgrrrl______/">https://www.instagram.com/mothgrrrl______/</a><br /><br />A Wonderful Place<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ruby-rodgers-620624932/a-wonderful-place">https://soundcloud.com/ruby-rodgers-620624932/a-wonderful-place</a><br /><br />Never Ending <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ruby-rodgers-620624932/never-ending">https://soundcloud.com/ruby-rodgers-620624932/never-ending</a><br /><br /><br />Music by Beau Corbeau:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/beaucorbeau">https://soundcloud.com/beaucorbeau</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beau.corbeau/">https://www.instagram.com/beau.corbeau/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnl-JJEdPoY5yDQj2KYcr4Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnl-JJEdPoY5yDQj2KYcr4Q</a><br /><br />Walking The Long Way Home<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5raePgtsxwkHDtqSqQ8hAy?si=ce2ae626d3af4196">https://open.spotify.com/track/5raePgtsxwkHDtqSqQ8hAy?si=ce2ae626d3af4196</a><br /><br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 What you give to the world<br />3:02 Morning routine <br />8:56 What regenerative living means to us<br />10:31 Picking papayas <br />12:31 Fermenting <br />15:20 Planting and propagating <br />18:07 Building a door <br />22:25 Building a worm farm <br />26:54 Night time routine{% endraw %}
