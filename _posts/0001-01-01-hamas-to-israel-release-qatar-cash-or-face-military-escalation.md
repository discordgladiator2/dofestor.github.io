{% raw %}Israel’s airstrikes in Gaza has left a huge dent on its economy and left many civilians unemployed. To resume its economic activities, Hamas is looking to gain access to Qatari aid which has been blocked by Israel. Hamas has demanded that Israel should allow Qatar to transfer $30 million aid to pay salaries. But Israel believes that the money will be used by Hamas for military purposes. Israel and the UN are particularly concerned about the resumption of Qatar cash payments. Hamas will be looking to rebuild its military capabilities, which were significantly weakened after last month’s violence. <br />#Hamas #IsraelPalestineConflict #Gaza #Qatar      <br /><br /><br /><br />Crux is your daily dose of the big, viral and relevant news in a few minutes.
