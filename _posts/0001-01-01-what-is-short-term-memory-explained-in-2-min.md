This information is in your short term memory and short after payment the information is forgotten.<br />When it comes to short-term memory capacity then the magic number seems to be 7 plus or minus 2 and it is also known as channel capacity.<br />If you have to remember the items to buy without writing them down then you are likely to cope with 5 to 9 items. If you have more than 10 then be sure you write them down.<br />Short-term memory is often confused with working memory, but they have different functions.<br />Working memory refers to the processes that are used to temporarily store, organize, and manipulate information. <br />While Short-term memory, on the other hand, refers only to the temporary storage of information.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick overview of what Short-Term Memory is and what role it plays in our life.<br />If you enjoyed this video I would really appreciate it if you could press the like button as this will help the video reach more people and spread the message.     <br />_________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
