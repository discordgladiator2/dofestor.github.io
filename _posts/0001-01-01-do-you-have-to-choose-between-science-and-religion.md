{% raw %}You’re talking about faith with someone and they tell you they don’t believe in God because they believe in science.  They say that you have to choose?  <br /><br /><br />What would you say?<br /><br /><br />There are those who believe that science and religion are in conflict and that someone must choose whether they want to believe in science or believe in religion.  If you ever hear this argument, here are four things to remember. <br /><br /><br />1. Modern Science was started by Christians.<br /><br /><br />2. Many of the best scientists today are people of faith. <br /><br /><br />3. Science explains “how”.  Religion explains “why”.  <br /><br /><br />4. Science can’t explain everything.<br /><br /><br />Donate Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://WhatWouldYouSay.org/give">http://WhatWouldYouSay.org/give</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://WhatWouldYouSay.org">http://WhatWouldYouSay.org</a><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ColsonCenter.org">http://ColsonCenter.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Breakpoint.org">http://Breakpoint.org</a><br /><br />Comment Policy: We encourage civil discussions.
