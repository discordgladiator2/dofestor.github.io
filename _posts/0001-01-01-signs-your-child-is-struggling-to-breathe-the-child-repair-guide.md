{% raw %}Parents -- If you see any of these signs, call your doctor right away!<br />_<br />How to tell your child is wheezing without a stethoscope? If your baby or child is wheezing, when should you worry? *The signs shown in this video are a simple way for you to know that your child is having difficulty breathing -- and a clear sign to seek medical attention urgently. These aren't the only possible signs, so always reach out to your doctor if you are concerned about your child even if these signs aren't present. <br />_<br />Big thanks to this little guy and his mom for allowing me to film a few moments of this so that we can show other parents what to look for.<br />_<br />Dr. Steve Silvestro is a pediatrician, mindfulness educator, bone marrow harvesting physician at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital's Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, and host of The Child Repair Guide Podcast.
