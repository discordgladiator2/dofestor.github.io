They said this life was a dream. Well it still is, and I never wanna wake. Standing in my backyard at our old practice space hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face.<br /><br />That was then, this is now. Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't.<br /><br />This is our corner of the world, where we can come to be ignored. <br />This is our point where we return. This is where I came from. <br /><br />Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me. Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me. We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now. We never questioned it, was more like when and how.<br /><br />That was then, this is now. Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't.<br /><br />This is our corner of the world, where we can come to be ignored.<br />This is our point where we return. This is where I came from.<br />This is what made us who we became. Where they know me, not just my name. There's not another place the same, this is where I came from. This is where I came from.<br /><br />Ya!<br /><br />You had another thing comin if you were sleepin' on us. Same old voices in my ear sayin' enough is enough. Well, I'm sayin' me and all my friends don't need you around.<br /><br />This is where I came from. <br />I'm right back at it again.<br /><br />This is what made us who we became, where they know me, not just my name. <br />There's not another place the same, this is where I came from.{% endraw %}
