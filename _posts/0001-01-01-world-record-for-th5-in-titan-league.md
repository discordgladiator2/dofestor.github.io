{% raw %}The World Record for Town Hall 5 in Clash of Clans. Judo Sloth Gaming shares the story of a TH5 Player who hit Titan League whilst Trophy Pushing. The Attack and Defense Strategy as well as generic trophy pushing tips, such as time required and shield management, are shared. The World Record for the Highest TH5 Trophies ever was by 'The World' who was featured in the TH6 Legend video. However Clan Castle changes, not being able to take Super Minions, have meant that it is now much more difficult to reach this amount of trophies and almost not possible at this stage. Tiziano actually hit 4714 Trophies on a different account prior to this change. Thank you for sharing your story and strategies with us. Good luck to all of the low level trophy pushers.
