{% raw %}Carolina shows how to tune and play an Etherwave Standard or Plus theremin by Moog, so you are able to use her octave technique throughout the whole pitch range.<br />Many thanks to Thierry Frenkel for sharing his experience on this subject!<br /><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://carolinaeyck.com">http://carolinaeyck.com</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/carolinaeyck">https://facebook.com/carolinaeyck</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CarolinaEyck">https://twitter.com/CarolinaEyck</a><br />BOOK A LESSON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carolinaeyck.com/lessons">https://carolinaeyck.com/lessons</a><br /><br />In order improve the linearity of the pitch field, you will need to install the &quot;Etherwave Standard Pitch Extension&quot; module by Thierry Frenkel.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ethermagic.eu/modules">http://www.ethermagic.eu/modules</a><br /><br />The ESPE01 module adds 2 octaves of range in the bass register of the Moog Etherwave Standard and PLUS theremins. It consists of a small electronic circuit that is installed onto the circuit board of the Etherwave. The installation should only be performed by people with experience in soldering and electronics.<br />The unaltered Etherwave theremin usually has a reliable pitch range from 1.5 octaves below middle C to 2.5 octaves above middle C. With the ESPE01 module installed the pitch range will start at 3.5 octaves below middle C, while the high register remains unaltered.<br />What is very important with any theremin is the linearity of the pitch field. Better linearity means more reliable pitch control. Usually the distances between notes are getting smaller in the high register, and larger in the low register, while in the lowest octave the distances gets smaller again. The ESPE01 module not only extends the pitch range, but also the linearity is improved, and continues into the lowest register.<br />Additionally the timbre of the Etherwave is a bit smoother when the ESPE01 module is present. This is especially noticeable in the low register, where with the original design the timbre can get quite harsh. With the ESPE01 module installed, the selected timbre is continued in the added low register, giving the Etherwave theremin an even more natural sonic flow to its full pitch range.<br />---<br /><br />If you have any further questions about Carolina, the theremin or her playing technique or want to book a theremin skype lesson, contact her via e-mail or on Facebook.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/carolinaeyck">https://www.facebook.com/carolinaeyck</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.carolinaeyck.com/pages/en/teaching/book-a-lesson.php">http://www.carolinaeyck.com/pages/en/teaching/book-a-lesson.php</a>{% endraw %}
