{% raw %}Right before the Coronavirus pandemic swept the nation and the rest of the world, I was able to pay a visit down to the Philadelphia Flower Show, which was my first time at the show. Luckily it wasn't canceled. I only had an hour to film, so I concentrated my time on the plants on competition submitted by the public. <br /><br /><br />__<br /><br />&quot;Plant One On Me&quot; is a channel produced by Summer Rayne Oakes of Homestead Brooklyn that is primarily focused on houseplants and outdoor gardening.
