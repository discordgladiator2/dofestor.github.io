The main outcome of our studies was that they stop around 95-100% of viruses that people emitting by your breath, sneezing, and coughing. People are the most contagious first days without symptoms, that's why we need masks for all.<br /><br />We have successfully tested the hypothesis at two main technical universities and it is highly recommended by a team of experts COVID CZECH under the coordination of the president of Czech Technical University in Prague. The team consists of a virologist, epidemiologist, doctors with specialization in population protection, chemists, and physicist with specialization if filtration. This group is an advisory expert group for the Czech government in Prague. Now it is obligatory to wear masks in the whole country. <br /><br />Please share and help to spread the key message that can save lives and slow the pandemic.<br />#Masks4All: &quot;I protect you, you protect me.&quot;<br /><br />OUR LATEST RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://masks4all.org/">https://masks4all.org/</a><br /> <br /><br />---<br />Useful links:<br />- Tutorial how to do a homemade mask: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNjpH...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNjpH...</a><br />- Another tutorial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qpcn...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qpcn...</a><br /><br />---<br />Scientific Studies<br />- &quot;We conclude that population-wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic. Mask use also reduces the reproduction number, possibly even to levels sufficient for containing an influenza outbreak.&quot; Brienen, Nicole CJ, et al. &quot;The effect of mask use on the spread of influenza during a pandemic.&quot; Risk Analysis: An International Journal 30.8 (2010): 1210-1218.&quot;<br />- &quot;Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.&quot; - van der Sande, M., Teunis, P., &amp; Sabel, R. (2008). Professional and home-made face masks reduce exposure to respiratory infections among the general population.
