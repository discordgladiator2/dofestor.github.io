{% raw %}Lyrics<br />This is my odysee, this is my illusion.<br />I'm lost in a dream of you and me, so caught up in confusion.<br />When will love be immortal, and truth be pure and free?<br />I was born to find the light, this is my oddysee.<br /><br />This is my odysee!<br /><br />This is my odysee, this is my illusion.<br />I'm lost in a dream of you and me, so caught up in confusion.<br />When will brothers stop the fight? When will our minds be free?<br />I was born to find the light, this is my oddysee.<br /><br />This is my odysee!{% endraw %}
