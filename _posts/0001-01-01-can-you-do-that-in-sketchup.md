{% raw %}“Can you do that in SketchUp?” -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/K3igXr">https://goo.gl/K3igXr</a><br /> <br /><br /> If you can believe it, SketchUp turned fifteen years old this past year. And still, we meet so many people who ask this question. In this video, we teamed up with real SketchUp users to share a story about just how much you can accomplish by designing and documenting your ideas in 3D. As you can see, we used a lot of native SketchUp to make this video! And along the way, we learned that, yes, you can do that in SketchUp.<br /> <br /><br /> Produced by: SketchUp &amp; Wit House<br /> Directed by: Cole Garrison (www.withouseproductions.com)<br /> Director of Photography: Dane Henry (www.danehenrydigital.com)<br /> Edit: Cole Garrison <br /> Color Correction: Peder Morgenthaler (www.framelinear.com)<br /> Music &amp; Sound Design: Ian McLeod &amp; Scotty Beam (www.cleod9music.com)<br /> Special thanks to: Daniel Brown, James Crowell, Eric Schimelpfenig, Solana James, Peter Kluzak, Keat Tan, Lisanne Libner, Aaron Dietzen, Ty Schalamon, Josh Reilly, Mike Hathorn, Ben Rouillard, Conor Joyce, Jack Heller, Khant Thu, Kenna Hausler, Noah Lerhner, George Spearing, Brandon Pizinger, Billy Mann,{% endraw %}
