{% raw %}Hello. In this video I have worked very hard to give my best with all my dancing skills. I always use to get inspired by Hrithik Roshan because of his dancing and acting skills. There's no one like him who can do such things with so ease which really looks awesome on the screen. Before making this video I rehearsaled for 2-3 days to make it look such good with a lot of enthusiasm and determination , also the editing is all done by me though I'm not so professional in that but I tried my best.<br /><br />What phone do you use for shooting ? <br />- Redmi Note 7 Pro<br /><br />What app do you use for editing?<br />- Capcut <br /><br />Where are you from ? <br />- I'm from Jhapa , Nepal.{% endraw %}
