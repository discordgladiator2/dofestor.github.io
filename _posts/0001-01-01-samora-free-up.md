{% raw %}«Free up» is a song about raising your consciousness, about freeing yourself from mental boundaries. Samora believes that you can reach so much more in life if you let go of excuses, if you have a true belief in yourself and your abilities and if you are capable of breaking down the prison you’ve built around yourself. And she thinks that you should let every impact in your life become a chance for bringing the best out of you.<br /><br />***<br /><br />CREDITS<br /><br />Produced by Res Staudenmann, Kiro MusicMaker/Ludovic Hoarau<br />Co-produced by Samora Souprayen<br />«Female Reggae Voices» – Riddim by Res Staudenmann, Thomas Ola<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/femalereggaevoices">https://www.instagram.com/femalereggaevoices</a><br />Lyrics by Samora Souprayen<br />Mixed by Kiro MusicMaker/Ludovic Hoarau<br />Mastered by Oli Bösch at Studio U3<br />Video by Samora Souprayen and Res Staudenmann<br /><br />Big thanks go out to W. and M.
