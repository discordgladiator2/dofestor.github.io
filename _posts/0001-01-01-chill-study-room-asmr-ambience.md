{% raw %}I like the aesthetic of these study type videos, so I thought I'd make my own version where, of course, a creature is peeking in the window, watching us studying, haha. Writing sounds are one of my favorites to listen to, in this one they are near constant, so I hope you'll enjoy them as well!<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/miracleforest">https://www.patreon.com/miracleforest</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/themiracleforest/">https://www.instagram.com/themiracleforest/</a><br /><br />Creatures and animals are almost always drawn by my husband, Adam.
