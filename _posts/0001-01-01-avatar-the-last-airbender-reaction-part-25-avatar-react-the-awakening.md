{% raw %}Avatar: The Last Airbender is out on Netflix and I've never seen it. <br />This is part 25 of my Avatar The Last Airbender reaction.<br /><br />Welcome to Avatar the Last Airbender reaction season 3!<br /><br />In this Avatar reaction video we are watching season 3 episode 1 The Awakening and Season 3 episode 2 The Headband.<br /><br />We ended season 2 on a cliffhanger, and so I was looking forwards to starting Avatar season 3. <br />The Awakening resumes the journey, with Aang having to come to terms with his devastating loss at the hands of Azula. <br />The Headband is a little more lighthearted and continues the journey, but this time into the heart of the Fire Nation. <br /><br />=================================================================================<br /><br />Extended reactions, additional bonus content (like the ATLA rewatch), and early access available on Patreon:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/agoodwintv">https://www.patreon.com/agoodwintv</a><br /><br /><br />One time donations also welcome :)<br /><br />ko-fi.com/agoodwintv<br /><br />=================================================================================<br /><br />Avatar synopsis: In a war-torn world of elemental magic, a young boy reawakens to undertake a dangerous mystic quest to fulfill his destiny as the Avatar, and bring peace to the world.
