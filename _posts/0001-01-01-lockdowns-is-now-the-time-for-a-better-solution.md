{% raw %}LOCKDOWNS: Is now the time for a better solution?<br /><br />The response to COVID-19 has without doubt created one of the single largest global catastrophes in modern history. Many countries around the world have been plunged into lockdowns and unorthodox restrictions on an unprecedented scale in an attempt to curb the virus. <br /><br />However, a growing body of evidence shows that lockdowns and other interventions have not only failed to influence the course of the pandemic, but have prolonged it and created a trail of devastating short-term and long-term collateral damage that now far exceeds the (actual and potential) harms caused by the virus:<br /><br />- UK Hospital waiting lists have reached a record high of 4.7 million people, with almost 390,000 of those waiting for over a year. (Source: NHS)<br />- Over 3 million people in backlog for cancer screening. (Source: Cancer Research UK)<br />- UK national debt at record high exceeding Â£2 trillion for first time ever. (Source: ONS)<br />- Over 112 billion days of education lost around the world. (Source: Save the Children)<br />- COVID-19 to plunge as many as 150 million people into extreme poverty around the world. (Source: The Economist)<br /><br />The long-established rulebook for managing pandemics was thrown out to tackle COVID-19, and now is the time to review the evidence and ask why?<br /><br />INTRODUCING THE 'LOCKDOWNS SUMMIT' - 17th July 2021<br /><br />Our goal is to provide a multidisciplinary critical assessment of the pandemic response and present a set of focused solutions via a landmark 1 day summit in London where we will present a series of engaging talks and panel discussions aimed at the public, policy makers, press and professional bodies. <br /><br />During this episode I will discuss the background to the summit and why we believe that now is the time to find a better solution. <br /><br />You can register to participate in the summit LIVE online here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.questioneverything.io">http://www.questioneverything.io</a>{% endraw %}
