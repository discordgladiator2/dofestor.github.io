{% raw %}The very world is at your fingertips as you fight for survival, fortune, and glory. Delve deep into cavernous expanses, seek out ever-greater foes to test your mettle in combat, or construct your own city - In the World of Terraria, the choice is yours!<br /><br />Blending elements of classic action games with the freedom of sandbox-style creativity, Terraria is a unique gaming experience where both the journey and the destination are as unique as the players themselves!<br /><br />Boomerangs are melee weapons that are thrown outwards when used and return to the player after a short amount of time. They have a much greater range than most other types of melee weapons but are not considered ranged due to not requiring any ammunition. Only one boomerang can be thrown at a time, with the exception of the stackable Light Discs and Bananarangs.<br /><br />The best modifier for all boomerangs is generally Godly. The two stackable boomerangs cannot receive any modifiers.<br /><br />What about the challenge?<br />To be honest, it was really fun and not so time consuming.<br />One conclusion would be that Boomerangs are a bit underrated.<br /><br />Music is not composed by me. I do not own any songs in any form or shape.<br />Music used is from Terraria (and mods), Dream's music playlist, Ansia Orchestra etc.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Don't forget to like and subscribe :){% endraw %}
