{% raw %}Jewelry tree<br />Size: w221 x h143 x d100 mm<br />Weight: 227 g.<br />Material: metal and wood<br />Color: black, white<br />-<br />The designer has simplified the pine tree, which is the symbol of winter, to be a jewelry tree. Its leaf is made for hanging the earing and necklace, while the trunk (tray) is made for placing the ring and other accessories. Furthermore, you can creatively choose your jewelry to put on the tree in order to make your own Christmas tree, which can reflect your personality. In addition, Winter Forest is made from wood and metal which can make you feel cozy in the winter.<br />-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.moreoverdesign.com">https://www.moreoverdesign.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/moreoverdesign/">https://www.facebook.com/moreoverdesign/</a><br />hello.moreover@gmail.com{% endraw %}
