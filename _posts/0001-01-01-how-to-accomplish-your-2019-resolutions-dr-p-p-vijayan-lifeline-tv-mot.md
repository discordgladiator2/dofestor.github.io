{% raw %}Ask yourself the following question: “What goal, if achieved today, would vastly improve my life?” For most, the important resolutions stem from areas of our lives where there is urgency. For example, pain and discomfort from diabetes and/or chronic inflammation can be improved by adopting a healthy diet. The stress of a hefty financial burden such as a rent increase or student loans could be relieved by increasing your income. These types of situations should be at the forefront of your mind when creating your goals. Others may choose a goal that is emotionally or spiritually nourishing. Nourishing goals feed your mind, body, and heart. They are proven to both decrease stress and add years to your life. Examples include spending more time with loved ones, working out, participating in your favorite leisure activity, or meditating. Because they feed into your positive emotions and values, nourishing goals provide a clear and balanced inner atmosphere, which gives you more energy to take action in other areas of your life. When you choose goals that are not significant or personally nourishing, they have little to no real impact on your life. Subconsciously, your mind knows that and will work against. In that case, you are unlikely to achieve your goals. So make sure to create goals that really matter. <br /><br />Dr. P.P Vijayan -  An Author, Mind Power Trainer, Psychologist, Success Coach,<br />a Business Strategist and Malayalam motivational trainer.<br /> <br />Visit : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lifelinemcs.org/">https://www.lifelinemcs.org/</a><br /><br />For more details - +91 97 46 78 91 50<br /><br />LIFELINE CONNECT.<br /><br />1.
