{% raw %}“Even When/The Best Part” is a song from the upcoming season two, episode three of the Disney+ series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. It is an accidental duet by the characters Nini (played by Olivia Rodrigo) and Ricky (Joshua Bassett), who are dealing with a long-distance relationship. They both plan to surprise each other with a song for Valentine’s Day, but they travel across states to meet, only to discover that the other is not there. Instead, they unknowingly perform these two songs simultaneously through voicemails to each other.<br /><br />Produced by:<br />Chantry Johnson &amp; Mitch Allan<br />Written by:<br />Mitch Allan, Michelle Zarlenga &amp; Chantry Johnson<br />Label: Walt Disney Records<br /><br />Copyright © Disney{% endraw %}
