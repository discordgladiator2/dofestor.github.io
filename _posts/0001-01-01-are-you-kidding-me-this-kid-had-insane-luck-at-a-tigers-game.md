{% raw %}This was truly crazy. You have to see it to believe it. I've been to more than 1,800 MLB games and never had a night like this. I knew that the pitching matchup would make it extra fun to chase foul balls behind home plate. Both starters (Matthew Boyd for the Detroit Tigers and Marco Gonzales for the Seattle Mariners) were fly-ball pitchers; according to their stats, they were more likely than average to get batters to swing underneath the ball, but OH MY GOD it ended up being much better than I thought. There was so much action, and the kid I brought to the game -- a recent high school grad named Mitch -- went absolutely nuts. <br /><br />So yeah, this was officially a &quot;Watch With Zack&quot; game. As I mentioned at the end of the video, here are some FAQ's that explain how it all works -- if you want to attend a game with me, please read this before you get in touch: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zackhample.com/watch-with-zack-faq">https://www.zackhample.com/watch-with-zack-faq</a><br /><br />Want to see a list of all the &quot;Watch With Zack&quot; games that I've ever done, along with detailed stats for all the baseballs that were snagged? Stadiums? Dates? Totals/records?

I did all the editing. And Mitch, as you saw, did most of the catching. Yow! <br /><br />Thanks for watching and please subscribe. :){% endraw %}
