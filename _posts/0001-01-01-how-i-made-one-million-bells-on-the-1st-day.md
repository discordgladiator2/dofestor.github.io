{% raw %}Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed!<br /><br />Today’s video is going to be a little different as we’re starting a brand new series. I want to show off glitches for Animal Crossing - New Horizons in an interesting and unique way. So, I want to make a series out of it, showcasing a few glitches in each episode, what they can be used for, and how I used them on my island. I want to also make it a playthrough on a new island, where I can do anything I want on. I also want to involve you guys in the series, so if you have any suggestions or requests, post them in the comments below! I’ll still be making regular episodes of Game Breakers, but I wanted to add this in there as a nice change of pace. Let me know what you think! To kick off our adventure, I used a duplication glitch to generate over two thousand lanterns and sold them to make one million bells right away. This will give us a nice base to start with and some spending money to spare!<br /><br />Today’s Features:<br />- Starting off on our new island<br />- Meeting our two new villagers<br />- [Glitch] Duplicating over 2,000 lanterns<br />- Earning one million bells<br />- Building our house<br /><br />Music:<br />1 - punchy would rather eat than study - demongummies - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRR_uODeDynIGUnPscb6MA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRR_uODeDynIGUnPscb6MA</a><br />2 - Rainy Day -  loriaoife - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=574SI3Bo49Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=574SI3Bo49Y</a> [Can’t find original user, so I’m linking the mix I found the song in] <br />3 - Track 15 - KronoMuzik - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KronoMuzik">https://www.youtube.com/c/KronoMuzik</a><br />4 - 5PM - cdb - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/cdbmusic">https://soundcloud.com/cdbmusic</a><br />Outro Song - B-Smit - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/brian-smith-387">https://soundcloud.com/brian-smith-387</a><br /><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CWillyHD">https://twitter.com/CWillyHD</a>{% endraw %}
