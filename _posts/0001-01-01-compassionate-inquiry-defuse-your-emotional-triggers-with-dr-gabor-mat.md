{% raw %}One of the most powerful emotional tools to get to know one self is Dr Gabor Mate’s Compassionate Inquiry.<br /><br />[Time Stamp Below]<br /><br />It’s interesting isn’t it that getting triggered is sometimes a subject of ridicule from some parts of society. <br /><br />Yet we all get triggered in life… and as profound teachers such as Dr Gabor Mate say “we shouldn’t be ashamed of it because it’s just an acknowledgement that we’ve suffered pain.”<br /><br />Dealing with our triggers though is the challenge and it requires a multidimensional approach from the physical, emotional, spiritual and energetic levels.<br /><br />Ultimately we need to get to know our self - the path to personal mastery.<br /><br />So in this video you’re going to learn:<br /><br />💥 What getting triggered really means and how that relates to spiritual bypassing? [02:12]<br />💥 Why our emotional underpinnings cause most of our illnesses? [09:28]<br />💥What is compassionate inquiry? [15:01]<br />💥You’ll see a real life example of compassionate inquiry in action from Dr Gabor Mate.
