{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.t-rex-effects.com.">http://www.t-rex-effects.com.</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The T-Rex REPLICA delay pedal has attained almost legendary status since its release a few years ago. Doubtless this is because of its warm analog-like repeats which have the ability to sound a lot like the tape echos of days gone by. It also allows us to change its tempo via remote MIDI control although I'm afraid I did not have the facilities with which to demonstrate this.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, is the REPLICA the greatest delay ever? Tell us what you think.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching and have a safe and happy Christmas 2009.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bye from Brett and Sadie. :){% endraw %}
