{% raw %}Will she start? What problems will we encounter? You should know by now it's never smooth sailing onboard Chuffed, but we are still ever closer to splash day!<br /><br />We will no longer be routinely replying to comments on YouTube, how ever patrons receive replies quickly through patreon.com and we can always be contacted by email about something specific. (YouTube comments take a lot of time to reply too, and we have found many comments to be not very nice or unnecessary, so its lower on our priority list. However we do always appreciate every ones support, and simply liking the video helps us a lot)<br /><br />Want to start Feeling Chuffed?
