{% raw %}Follow up to my last video. This is not meant to stir stuff up, but be a clarification. Iâ€™ll talk a bit more in the comments if necessary. I've never done videos like this but I felt it was necessary to help clear some of the air. I also forgot to turn off the auto-contrast so it's a bit too contrasted.{% endraw %}
