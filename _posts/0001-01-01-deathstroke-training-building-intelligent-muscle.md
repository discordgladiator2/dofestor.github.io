{% raw %}My eBook and training program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />My physical book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/</a><br /><br /><br />Full post: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/?p=86209">https://www.thebioneer.com/?p=86209</a><br /><br /><br />Deathstroke is a character known for his physical and mental prowess, capable of thinking at &quot;9X the speed&quot; of a normal human. This, along with his tactical mind, makes him more than a match for Batman and Nightwing.<br /><br /><br />What would a Deathstroke training program incorporate to mimic these abilities? In this video, I argue that we can attain a similar level of athleticism by training complex movements that are &quot;proprioceptively demanding.&quot; Training such as slacklining, juggling, advanced calisthenics, and more may help to increase working memory and body awareness. <br /><br /><br />Digging into the studies, this kind of Deathstroke training could directly improve skill acquisition, decision making, focus, and more. Enjoy the video and let me know what you think: do you incorporate a skills training day? Will you now? What other methods did I miss?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com​">https://www.thebioneer.com​</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​">https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​">https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​">https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer">https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer</a>{% endraw %}
