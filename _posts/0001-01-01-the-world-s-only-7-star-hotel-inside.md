The reason it took so long to complete is that it was constructed on an artificial island.<br />- The Architect designed it to resemble the sail of a ship. <br />- You’ll be given an option to either ride to the hotel or take a private helicopter. <br />- The sail-like structure is built on sand. It’s just over 1000 feet tall, with 250 concrete columns. Each of them is approximately 5 feet in diameter, and they dive to 148 feet below sea-levels. <br />- Walking around, you’ll see flashes of real gold from every direction: In the decorations, on the furniture, even on the chandeliers. <br />- You’re provided with an exclusive butler for your suite. You won’t have to lift a finger. <br />- The suites are so big, it’ll take more than 30 minutes for the butler to show you around. <br />- If you decide to be more adventurous and book one of the Royal Suites, you’re in for a big shock. Each of the suites are approximately 8,400 square feet, and they cover the whole floor. <br />- In order to make sure that you get top-quality sleep, the hotel does something extravagant: they present you with 17 varieties of pillows to pick from.<br />- For lunch, you’re taken to the 27th floor – The restaurants is called “Al Muntaha” which means “The highest”. The windows start from the floor, and stretch all the way up to the ceiling. <br />- At dinner, you can book a table at the Al Mahara, which translates to Oyster Shell. You’ll enter the dining room through a golden, shell-shaped corridor. <br />- Near the restaurant, there are also a few private rooms with their own aquariums inside. They have gold shells hanging from the ceiling with special lighting. <br />- Recently, the most luxurious bar in the world opened in the hotel, and it’s called Gold on 27. It offers unique drinks, and the trained bar tenders keep their recipes secret. <br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
