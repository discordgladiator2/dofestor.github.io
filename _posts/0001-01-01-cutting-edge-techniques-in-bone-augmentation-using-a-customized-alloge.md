{% raw %}Webinar by Oliver Blume<br />In this webinar Dr. Blume will share his experience and detailed information about using customized allogenic bone blocks for bone augmentation in challenging situations. As one of the first users he will present clinical data and cases from his 5 years of experience using maxgraft® bonebuilder, giving insights into his surgery methods and flap design techniques.<br />Dr. Dr. Oliver Blume is an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon with a private practice in Munich/Germany, where he focuses on implantology and complex bone defect augmentation.  He is a Visiting Professor at the Semmelweis University Budapest/Hungary and Founding Member of the European Centers of Dental Implantology (ECDI). Dr. Blume participates in different projects for the treatment of cleft lip/ cleft palate and is President of the subvisory board of the German Cleft Child Aid Society. <br /><br />maxgraft® bonebuilder is a customized allogenic bone block for two-stage alveolar ridge augmentation. Based on CT/CBCT scans of the patient, the bone block is virtually designed using the latest 3D-CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) technology. The individual design provides an optimal fit between local bone and graft, enabling rapid revascularization and fast graft incorporation.
