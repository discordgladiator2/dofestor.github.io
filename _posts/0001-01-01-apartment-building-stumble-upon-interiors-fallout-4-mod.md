{% raw %}Apartment Building from Stumble Upon Interiors, a mod for Fallout 4.<br /><br />Stumble Upon Interiors adds several new, immersive interiors to the Commonwealth, all atmospheric and interesting to explore in their own ways. The interiors are relatively close to vanilla Fallout 4 in terms of loot, lighting and encounters.<br /><br />This apartment building has seen better days, but the top penthouse flat has kept some of the bohemian flair of its former inhabitants. <br /><br />Oh, and maybe some of it's former inhabitants...<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15539/?">http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/15539/?</a>{% endraw %}
