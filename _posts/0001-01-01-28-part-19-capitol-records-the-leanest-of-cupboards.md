{% raw %}In Part 19 we check out in the Mid America Mediocrity that Capitol pumped out, and the few great lps they slipped in between.<br /><br />I love the Peggy Lee, the Frank, the Dean O, the Prima etc....<br />But in all of this you can see how unwilling they were to take a chance on race music as it was called!{% endraw %}
