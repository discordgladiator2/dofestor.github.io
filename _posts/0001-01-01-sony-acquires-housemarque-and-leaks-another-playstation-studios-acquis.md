{% raw %}Today we have some very exciting PlayStation news to cover as it was announced today that Sony has officially acquired Housemarque, the developers of PS5 exclusive Returnal, as a first party PlayStation studio. This is a pretty significant studio purchase for Sony and will go a long way in boosting the already prolific PlayStation Studios profile. On top of that it seem that Sony's Japan PlayStation Twitter account may have leaked another major studio acquisition that may be announced sometime soon. <br /><br />--<br /><br />become a channel member:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-r774_ow9ojRSQnDv-PpyA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-r774_ow9ojRSQnDv-PpyA/join</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />buy some merch:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-r774_ow9ojRSQnDv-PpyA/store">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-r774_ow9ojRSQnDv-PpyA/store</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />twitter:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/xMBGx​​​​">https://twitter.com/xMBGx​​​​</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />channel art:rickmejia3@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />source:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/29/welcoming-housemarque-to-the-playstation-studios-family/#sf247184082">https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/29/welcoming-housemarque-to-the-playstation-studios-family/#sf247184082</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />source:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2021/06/sony_acquisition_of_bluepoint_games_supposedly_leaked_by_image_mistake">https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2021/06/sony_acquisition_of_bluepoint_games_supposedly_leaked_by_image_mistake</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />Subscribe to the channel to stay up to date with the latest PlayStation news and info.<br /><br /><br />Tags: PlayStation news,PS5,PlayStation 5,Housemarque,Returnal,PlayStation studios,Sony studios,PlayStation acquisition,sony acquisition,PlayStation first party,Ps5 news,PlayStation 5 news,housemarque games,returnal ps5,bluepoint games,bluepoint,ps5 games,ps5 exclusives,playstation 5 games,returnal gameplay,ps5 gameplay,ps5 update,ps5 rumor,ps5 leak,playstation leak,Sony leak,ps5 info,daily gaming news,ps news,sony buying studios,sony rumor,mbg{% endraw %}
