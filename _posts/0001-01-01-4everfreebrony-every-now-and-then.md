{% raw %}This is the first track from my 2012 album, Reflections. You can find it everywhere. Here it is at bandcamp:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://garrisonulrich.bandcamp.com/album/reflections">https://garrisonulrich.bandcamp.com/album/reflections</a><br /><br />This song is about facing your fears; we need to find that which grounds us, and turn back to it, every now and then.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />(v1)<br />Once around the world <br />You wish you could go back <br />The medal that you earned <br />Or Shiny silver plaque <br />The folks you met along the way <br />The places you wish you could stay <br /><br />(chorus)<br />Some of us donâ€™t really like the ocean <br />We'll all have to see it once again <br />We turn back to the things we can't escape from <br />Every now and then <br /><br />(v2)<br />Once you know you're in <br />You know you can't go back <br />And soon you're caught again <br />The innocence you lack <br />No matter what they say to you <br />You know there's nothing you can't do. <br /><br />(repeat chorus)<br /><br />(bridge)<br />Every now and then <br />Cryin in the end <br />We'll all end up cryin' in the end <br /><br />(whistling verse)<br /><br />(repeat chorus)<br /><br />Every now and then.<br /><br />If you read this far, congratulations! Here's a link to my first public performance of this song at a talent show:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdY87kjWC5M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdY87kjWC5M</a>{% endraw %}
