{% raw %}Donate to The Trevor Project here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mcc.live/pride">https://www.mcc.live/pride</a><br /><br />More than 1.8 million LGBTQ youth seriously consider suicide in the U.S. every year, and the past year has been particularly hard for LGBTQ young people who are isolated or struggling. This Pride season, I am proud to support The Trevor Project, the world’s largest crisis intervention and suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ youth. The Trevor Project is here for the LGBTQ youth who need support, by providing free, 24/7 crisis counselling. Join me in supporting their mission by making a donation now.<br /><br /><br />Resources for International Users: TrevorSpace – The Internet isn't always the safest and most affirming place for LGBTQ young people. TrevorSpace offers a solution. With 350,000 users in more than 100 countries, TrevorSpace is the world's largest social networking site of its kind, offering life-affirming friendship, human connection, and intersectional peer support online.<br /><br />I would not ask anyone to donate to a cause that I myself would not donate to; therefore I have made a 500$ donation to The Trevor Project before the event started.{% endraw %}
