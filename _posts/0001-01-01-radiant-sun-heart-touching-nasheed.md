{% raw %}Nasheed by Ahmad &amp; Muhammad al Muqit (Brothers)<br />Ahmad Al Muqit - أحمد المقيط @ahmuqq<br />Muhammad Al Muqit - محمد المقيط @i_m_g1<br /><br />DISCLAIMER (PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING)<br />Unfortunetly a few of our viewers have misunderstood the meaning of this nasheed and taken the lyrics out of context, this nasheed is in no way calling upon the sun or asking the sun for guidance as some have suggested, nasheed is a form of poetry... and the language and meaning is always very difficult to translate to english because the english language is flawed in comparison but we do translate to the best of our ability.<br /><br />The sun is a creation of Allah (swt) and is worthy of our respect and awe due to the fact that life on earth cannot exist without this creation and by recognising Allah's signs in the creation we recognise the greatness of our creator... <br /><br />Allah (swt) has said, And of His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate yourselves before the sun, nor before the moon, but prostrate yourselves before Allah Who created them, if it is Him that you serve.<br /><br />The nasheed should make us ponder over His signs and bring us closer to Allah (not the opposite) we follow strict guidelines with all our content and would never endorse the idea of sun worship, if anyone can prove that this nasheed suggests worshipping the sun we will remove it immediately! may Allah (swt) grant us all understanding and keep us firm on the path. ameen<br /><br />► Subscribe Now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/2tmfa8">https://goo.gl/2tmfa8</a><br />► Donate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/saveourchannel">https://www.gofundme.com/saveourchannel</a><br />► Become A Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/mercifulservant">https://www.patreon.com/mercifulservant</a><br /><br />If you like our content and would like to stay updated please subscribe and press the bell (next to the subscribe button) to receive updates and notifications! <br /><br />MS Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.themercifulservant.com">http://www.themercifulservant.com</a><br />MS Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MercifulServantHD">https://www.facebook.com/MercifulServantHD</a><br />MS Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MercifulServnt">https://twitter.com/MercifulServnt</a><br />MS Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/mercifulservant">http://instagram.com/mercifulservant</a><br />MS SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.soundcloud.com/mercifulservant">http://www.soundcloud.com/mercifulservant</a><br />Personal Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mercifulservant">https://www.facebook.com/mercifulservant</a><br /><br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: <br />Any of the views expressed by the speakers do not necessarily represent the views of The Merciful Servant or any other projects it may have or intend to do.
