{% raw %}Bobby Goldsboro - A Butterfly For Bucky (The story of Buck) 1976<br /><br /><br /><br />Buck was born on a beautiful morning<br /><br />And I felt very proud<br /><br />Lets just say its not every day<br /><br />That you see me cry out loud<br /><br /><br /><br />Hair like Sunshine, a smile as Warm<br /><br />And the prettiest eyes you'll find<br /><br />One day last spring my lady and I<br /><br />Found out those eyes were blind<br /><br /><br /><br />Save a Butterfly for me daddy<br /><br />They sound so pretty to me<br /><br />Tell me about the butterfly<br /><br />And all the things you see<br /><br /><br /><br />Well over there Buck lies a beautiful meadow<br /><br />With the colors of gold and tan<br /><br />With the smell of hay and the sound of crickets<br /><br />Here Buck, Take my hand<br /><br /><br /><br />And I wish you could see that big oak tree<br /><br />With its limbs reaching up to the sky<br /><br />And a bed of flowers growing at its feet<br /><br />And a Big Yellow Butterfly<br /><br /><br /><br />Save a butterfly for me Daddy<br /><br />Before they disappear<br /><br />Save a butterfly for me Daddy<br /><br />and on his cheek was a tiny tear<br /><br /><br /><br />So we packed up our bags our hopes and our dreams<br /><br />And we all went to town that day<br /><br />I sneaked off to the hospital chapel<br /><br />I got down on my knees and I prayed<br /><br /><br /><br />Save a butterfly for my boy Lord<br /><br />I sure need nothing for me<br /><br />Except an angel of joy to touch him<br /><br />The way that he's touched me<br /><br /><br /><br />Now there are things in this universe<br /><br />That we just don't understand<br /><br />And through an open window came a butterfly<br /><br />to land on Bucks small hand<br /><br /><br /><br />The doctors face was strangely white<br /><br />As if it just couldn't be<br /><br />But the light was in my boys face<br /><br />Daddy he said, I can see<br /><br /><br /><br />Save a Butterfly for us Bucky<br /><br />We're all so blind it seems<br /><br />For we've not seen the magic<br /><br />In the power of a little boys dreams{% endraw %}
