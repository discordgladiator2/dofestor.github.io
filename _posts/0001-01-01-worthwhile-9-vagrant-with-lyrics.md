Do you feel like me?<br />Let me look in your eyes so I can see if your heart burns just like mine.<br /> <br />Don't bury what you hide from. We apply to overcome.<br />My tight rope turned to this train wreck. Undone.<br /> <br />I came a long way from home just to find I lost my way<br />And now the path back seems a lot longer than it did when I came.<br />Everything and everyone is so different around me<br />Or maybe I'm the one who's changed.<br /> <br />Something keeps this tired heart going.<br />It's in the darkest times, we find ourselves growing.<br />The mind's the standard of the man.<br />I surround myself with those who remind me of who I am.<br /><br /><br />*All lyrics by James Teyler except the adapted poem from Isaac Watts' &quot;False Greatness&quot; by Joseph Merrick.{% endraw %}
