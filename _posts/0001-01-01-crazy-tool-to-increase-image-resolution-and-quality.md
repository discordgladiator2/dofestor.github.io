{% raw %}I had to share this fantastic image enhancement tool called Let's Enhance. I can totally see it coming in handy quite frequently for both new and experienced designers. It does one thing and it does it well. Check out the examples in the video to see what I mean.<br /><br />Sometimes you come across a piece of software that is so useful and so mindblowing that you simply have to share it with the community. <br /><br />Use case: You're a freelancer and some of your client's assets are a bit pixelated and small. No problem, let's enhance will not only increase the resolution but ALSO the quality of the image (Using their &quot;Smart Enhance&quot; feature).<br /><br />Check it out here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://letsenhance.io/">https://letsenhance.io/</a><br /><br />Let me know your thoughts in the comments!<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:55 Letâ€™s Enhance<br /><br />-<br />Learn how to build custom websites with Webflow FAST:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/WebflowWebclass2020">https://bit.ly/WebflowWebclass2020</a><br />-<br />Find me on other social media platforms:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ransegall/">https://www.instagram.com/ransegall/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ransegall">http://twitter.com/ransegall</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ran-segal...">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ran-segal...</a><br />-<br />Gear &amp; Book Recommendations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ohFOuj">http://bit.ly/2ohFOuj</a><br /><br />#imageenhance #imageresolution #pixelatedimage #imageupscale #design #graphicdesign #webdesign<br /><br />Thanks for watching the video!{% endraw %}
