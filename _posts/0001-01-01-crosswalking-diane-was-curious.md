{% raw %}At a little after 4 AM yesterday morning, Marcus Ingram (36) almost lost his life. He lost control of his motorcycle at River Drive and Mound Street, just outside the Village of East Davenport. You can read more about the incident, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://qctimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/motorcycle-crash-injures-davenport-man/article_c52abc60-a3c0-549e-8963-a4dc0c8f8f4c.html">https://qctimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/motorcycle-crash-injures-davenport-man/article_c52abc60-a3c0-549e-8963-a4dc0c8f8f4c.html</a><br /><br />Although the wind was blowing out of the east, it did little to take the sting out of the 95Â°+ heat.<br /><br />A youngster on her bike watched me set up. She rode around the parking lot behind me doing very little to hide her curiosity. I said hello and she returned the greeting. Three times she sat down on a bench behind me. When I looked at her she would smile and look away.<br /><br />Her name was Diane. She is 14.<br /><br />I eventually let us both off the hook by striking up a conversation with her. I learned that she attends the largest megachurch in town--one formerly associated with disgraced former popular preacher James McDonald's ministry. She attends regularly.<br /><br />Having several siblings, one of her brothers was killed in combat. Her stepfather is antagonistic to all things Jesus.<br /><br />Diane professed faith in Christ but had no idea as to what the gospel is. I communicated the gospel to her. She said she believed. While I don't know if that's true, I spent the rest of our time together trying to encourage her and gave her a tract for her stepfather.{% endraw %}
