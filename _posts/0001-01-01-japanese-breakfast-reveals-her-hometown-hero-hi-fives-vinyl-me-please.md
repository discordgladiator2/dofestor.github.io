{% raw %}In 'Soft Sounds' — part concept album, part personal catalogue — Michelle Zauner creates a parallel between the sci-fi notion of exploring another planet and the deeply intimate process of exploring new emotional terrain. It’s abstract and metaphorical, in a way, but remains the antithesis of pretension. Her ability to take innovative concept — both lyrical and audible — and make it approachable makes the album intriguing whether it’s your first listen or your 200th. It’s a master blend of synth, her signature shoegaze, adventurous soundscape crafting, and hints of ‘80s-esques grandeur that buttresses a literary take on everything to road head to unconditional love.<br /><br /><br />___ <br /><br /><br />Her Picks: <br />The Flaming Lips 'The Soft Bulletin’ <br />Nils Frahm 'All Melody’ <br />The Jesus and Mary Chain 'Psychocandy’ <br />Modest Mouse 'The Moon &amp; Antarctica’ <br />Michael Jackson 'Off the Wall’ <br /><br />___<br /><br />Presented by CLIF® MOJO® Bar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://clifbar.com/mojosnacks">http://clifbar.com/mojosnacks</a><br />___<br /><br /><br />Vinyl Me, Please is a monthly record subscription for music lovers, by music lovers.
