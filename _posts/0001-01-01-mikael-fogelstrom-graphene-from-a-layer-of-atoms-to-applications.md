{% raw %}Graphene is often called the “material of superlatives” because so much about it is extreme. Made of a single layer of carbon atoms, it is the thinnest structure ever (it is actually 2D). It is impermeable, stronger than diamond, and the best thermal conductor found to date. Mikael Fogelstrom, head of the Graphene Institute at Chalmers University, explains graphene’s chemical structure, its potential applications, and why this might just catapult us into the next Carbon Age. <br /><br />Mikael is a Professor in theoretical physics and a Scientific Leader of the Graphene Centre at Chalmers University of Technology. His main topics of research are mesoscopic and unconventional superconductivity. Recently, he has added research on graphene and topological materials to his portfolio.<br /><br />About the TED Institute: We know that innovative ideas and fresh approaches to challenging problems can be discovered inside visionary companies around the world. The TED Institute helps surface and share these insights. Every year, TED works with a group of select brands to identify internal ideators, inventors, connectors, and creators. Drawing on the same rigorous regimen that has prepared speakers for the TED main stage, TED Institute works closely with each partner, overseeing curation and providing intensive one-on-one talk development to sharpen and fine tune ideas. <br /><br />Learn more at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ted.com/ted-institute">http://www.ted.com/ted-institute</a><br /><br />Follow TED Institute on Twitter @TEDPartners<br />Follow more business thinking worth sharing from TED at roi.ted.com{% endraw %}
