Hopefully, you'll enjoy listening and looking at these ambience videos made to relax you, transport you to faraway places, help you study or work, and maybe even trigger your ASMR.<br /><br />Equipment I use:<br />Nikon D3300 (DSLR for recording green screens, black screens and taking photographs)<br />Tascam DR-40 (mic for recording sounds)<br />Wacom Intuos Art (pen tablet for compositing work)<br />Audio-Technica ATH-M40x headphones<br />Green screen<br />Black screen<br />(Hubby uses Wacom Cintiq 16. He sometimes helps me, since he's an illustrator, and I can't draw, lol.)<br /><br />Software:<br />Adobe Photoshop<br />Adobe Premiere Pro<br />Adobe After Effects<br />Adobe Soundbooth<br />Audacity<br /><br />All video and audio work is my own original creation. (And illustrator husband's sometimes, lol.){% endraw %}
