{% raw %}Pores. This video is on how to shrink pores, get rid of pores, on face, on nose, to clear, reduce and tightening pores.<br /><br />About a year ago we made the how to stop acne video and still to this day I honestly can’t believe the amount of love and views its had, nearly 1 million!  Thank you. Now one of the most popular comments on there has been about pores and more specifically how to shrink them, so we decided let’s do a video on this topic. I really hope my tips help you and always remember you’re awesome!<br /><br />WHAT ARE ENLARGED PORES:<br />Enlarged pores are depressions in the facial skin surface that contain one or more openings to the ducts carrying sweat and oil from their respective eccrine glands and sebaceous glands.<br /><br />WHO GETS ENLARGED PORES:<br />Enlarged pores can be seen at all ages and in all ethnic groups. Certain ethnic groups may have larger pores, particularly those of African and Indian ancestry. Pores often appear larger with age.<br /><br />There are conflicting data on whether men or women are more prone to large pores. In women, pore size may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, with the largest pore size occurring during ovulation.<br /><br />WHAT CAUSES ENLARGED PORES:<br />Factors that may lead to enlarged pores include:<br /><br />• Increased sebum production<br />• Hair follicle size<br />• Use of comedogenic products<br />• Loss of skin elasticity with age<br />• Sun damage<br /><br />Acne is associated with enlarged pores — when sometimes open comedones (blackheads) can be seen within a pore. Inflammatory acne may cause enlarged pores through weakening sebaceous gland and hair follicle openings, making them more prone to blockage.<br /><br />SKIN AGEING AND SUN DAMAGE:<br />As we age our skin naturally becomes less elastic, now there’s not much we can do about this but sun damage can also cause ageing of our skin which can lead to enlarged pores. <br /><br />Use a sunscreen every day that protects against UVA and UVB radiation, now the good news is I did a detailed video on sunscreens not long ago which teaches you how buy the best sunscreen from any pharmacy and what ingredients to look out for.<br /><br />Feel free to watch here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf5vsdcJMzQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf5vsdcJMzQ</a><br /><br />SEBUM:<br />Ever heard of sebum? If not you’re not missing out, it’s basically the oily secretion found on our scalp and face produced by our sebaceous glands.<br /><br />Now increased sebum production can lead to enlarged pores, we all produce different amounts depending on factors like age, gender and even weight. Many of the factors we can’t change however if you are overweight, weight loss has been reported to reduce sebum production which may help with enlarged pores.<br /><br />Feel free to watch my how to lose weight video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn8BNJEQ05w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn8BNJEQ05w</a><br /><br />NON COMEDOGENIC SKIN CARE PRODUCTS:<br />Non comedogenic skin care products, is basically a fancy word for products that won’t clog your pores. When pores clog they expand, which can you make your pores more noticeable. <br /><br />So to avoid clogged pores looks for the following terms on everything your apply to your face, <br /><br />• Non-comedogenic<br />• Oil free<br />• Won’t clog pores<br /><br />If you don’t see one of these terms then don’t use them. <br /><br />ACNE:<br />I’m afraid acne is associated with enlarged pores, so we need to keep it under control with correct care and treatment to avoid it becoming inflammatory and causing those enlarged pores. <br /><br />Now if you haven’t seen my how to treat acne video feel free to watch it for more information here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3wl79bQOKw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3wl79bQOKw</a><br /><br />But please remember to always see your doctor if it’s not under-control or if it’s causing you any distress. <br /><br />SPEAK TO YOUR DOCTOR:<br />Don’t leave it, remember pores generally can appear larger as we age so if you feel that your pores are enlarged then always speak to your doctor as there are various different treatments that can be prescribed to help, a few of which can actually help reduce the sebum we spoke about earlier.<br /><br /><br />Want to see more videos about everything health and pharmacy?
