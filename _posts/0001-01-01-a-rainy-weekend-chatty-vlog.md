{% raw %}I thought I'd take you along with me during a chilled weekend, complete with some typically British weather... <br />I also want to highlight that this is NOT a video showing what I ate over the weekend - I didn't film everything I ate because I don't think that's very helpful for me or for you! <br /><br />Mentioned in this video: <br />Ice Cream Matcha from Bird and Blend: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.birdandblendtea.com/products/ice-cream-matcha-tea?variant=37506783772833">https://www.birdandblendtea.com/products/ice-cream-matcha-tea?variant=37506783772833</a><br />'Green is Groovy' t-shirt from Hannah-Michelle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hannah-michelle.com/shop">https://hannah-michelle.com/shop</a> (@hannahmichellebayley on instagram) <br /><br />Thank you for watching! I hope you're having a beautiful day üåª<br /><br />Find me on instagram: @molly.ella.jones<br />Follow me on Goodreads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132126005-molly-jones">https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132126005-molly-jones</a><br /><br /><br />Currently reading: 'Adam Bede' by George Eliot<br />Where I get my music: Musicbed <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.musicbed.com/">https://www.musicbed.com/</a><br /><br />FAQs:<br /><br />‚ú® How old are you? 20<br />‚ú® Where are you from? London, UK<br />‚ú® What breed is your dog?! Benji is a cavapoo (half Poodle, half Cavalier King Charles Spaniel)<br />‚ú®What are you doing on YouTube? I started this channel to share my recovery from anorexia, and I hoped to create a safe and positive space online to encourage others in their own recovery journeys. I also wanted to raise awareness about eating disorders and mental health generally. Those goals are still very much the foundation of my channel, but as I get further into my recovery, more of my personality and interests are returning, so I've started sharing more about my life generally and the other things that I'm passionate about.<br />‚ú® What are you doing with your life?! At the moment, I'm focusing on recovering from anorexia, and on healing my mental health generally. However, I started studying English Language and Literature at the University of Oxford in 2019, and was forced to take some time out due to my mental health, but I am hoping to return this October (2021)! Other than that, I have a beautiful lil pup called Benji (the real star of this channel), I am a peanut butter fanatic, and I aspire to be an actress.{% endraw %}
