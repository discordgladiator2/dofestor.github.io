{% raw %}Hello /(*^▽^*)/ <br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />TW: EATING DISORDERS <br />A little disclaimer since I get questions about my health a lot. I’m suffering from eating disorders now almost 7 years. I’m trying to recover but as you know sometimes I’m worse sometimes i’m better. I’m aware of the negative effects of my eating habits since I have most of them. Telling me to just eat normal amount of food won’t help. Eating disorders are about our body health and how we eat but it’s mostly psychological disorder. It won’t matter if I will eat 2000 calories per day because either I will binge or starve myself do to stress or gloomy mood. I'm aware most of you have good intentions but I have had tried every possible way of recovery. Please if you want to give me advice be nice and respectfull. If you're new in eating disorders or just want to talk/get help message me on my instagram! I'm anserwing everyone.<br /><br />instagram; applediaryy <br />email; applediary.collaboration <br /><br />Love yourself! ☆彡{% endraw %}
