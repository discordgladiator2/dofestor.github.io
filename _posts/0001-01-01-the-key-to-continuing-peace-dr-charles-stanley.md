In fact, as we've already experienced, we see that the world is unstable. But our heavenly Father assures us that He will uphold us and give us inner contentment—and nothing can take that away.  In this message, Dr. Stanley explains the important topic of peace by highlighting Life Principle #12: &quot;Peace with God is the fruit of oneness with God.&quot;<br /><br />**This sermon was recorded before COVID-19.
