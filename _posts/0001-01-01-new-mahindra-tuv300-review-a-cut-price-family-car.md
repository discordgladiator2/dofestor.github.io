{% raw %}Prominent Indian manufacturer Mahindra is hoping to expand further into the passenger car market with this, the TUV300. Do note, you should pronounce it &quot;Tee-You-Vee-Three-Double-Oh&quot;. And as you'll see in the video, that's actually what the car calls itself...<br /><br />It features 7 seats, a tough-as-nails chassis and a fair amount of spec. But it's real appeal is the price. At R229 900, brand new with all the features Mahindra has at its disposal thrown in for good measure, the TUV300 represents impressive value for money.<br /><br />However, a car in this Compact Family Car segment, at this price point, has its limitations and drawbacks. And for details on those, you'll just have to watch our latest video.{% endraw %}
