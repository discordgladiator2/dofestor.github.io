{% raw %}Mo Brooks Goes Completely Off The Deep End After Getting Served by Eric Swalwell<br /><br />ðŸ“Œ SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, COMMENT &amp; SHARE for MORE!<br /><br />There is something about Alabama because when they select their Republican representatives to send to Washington, they arenâ€™t sending their best. For example, Alabama could have had Doug Jones as Senator; the problem is heâ€™s too educated in the commonsense department, so they replace him with a stooge name Tommy Tuberville who is suffering from a severe case of stupid. On his first assignment in congress, he votes to overturn US Democracy and thwart the peopleâ€™s will.<br /><br />And then there is Alabama Congressman clown Morris Jackson &quot;Mo&quot; Brooks Jr. <br /><br />#aDDmorejuiceTv #EricSwalwell #News<br /><br />COMMENTARY/NARRATION Provided By Jenell for aDDmoreJuice TV<br /><br />OUTRO Music Credit: NEFFEX Music -  #aDDmoreJuiceTV{% endraw %}
