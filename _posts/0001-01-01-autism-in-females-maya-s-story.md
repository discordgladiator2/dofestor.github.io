{% raw %}The early diagnosis of Autism can significantly impact the quality of the life of the person. Therefore, it is essential to ensure an accurate and early diagnosis of autism. Unfortunately, autism’s diagnosis is delayed by several years in female patients compared to males. In this video we will be following the journey of Maya and how going undiagnosed can impact the life of young girls. We will also touch on current research that is making a positive impact on this field. <br />This video was created by demystifying medicine students Alexandra Marques, Armin Sariaslani, and Emilyanne Stocks. <br /><br />Copyright McMaster University 2020.<br /><br />References: <br /><br />Bargiela, S., Steward, R., &amp; Mandy, W.
