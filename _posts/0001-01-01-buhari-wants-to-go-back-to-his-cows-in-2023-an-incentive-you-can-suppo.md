{% raw %}The last of Africa’s independence heroes and Zambian first president, Kenneth Kaunda, dies at 97. Dr. Damages bid Kenneth Kaunda farewell. Meanwhile, ten million Nigerians slipped into poverty under President Buhari. But Buhari reported that he lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty. Dr. Damages points out that it is over a 20-million-swing in the lie index and, as such, deserves a lie tag. Why Premium Times did not call it a lie. While other ex-presidents go home and build a presidential library, Buhari wants to go back to his cows. Dr. Damages comes up with an attractive incentive to make him go back to his cows earlier than May 29, 2023. Consider signing up.{% endraw %}
