It severely undermines the role of toluene as an aromatic solvent and says simply &quot;The treated wood pieces were then immersed in ethanol for 5 hours to remove any remaining chemicals and then transferred to toluene so as to exchange the ethanol in the wood.&quot; I'll leave that one up to the reader :) <br /><br />For the original paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/7/5/eabd7342.full.pdf">https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/7/5/eabd7342.full.pdf</a><br /><br />Follow me on social media:<br />üì∏ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/xylafoxlin/">https://www.instagram.com/xylafoxlin/</a><br />üê¶ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/xylafoxlin">https://twitter.com/xylafoxlin</a><br />üìò <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/xylareifoxlin">https://www.facebook.com/xylareifoxlin</a><br /><br />üíåSEND ME THINGSüì¶:<br />Xyla Foxlin<br />10866 Washington Blvd. # 610‚Äã<br />Culver City, CA 90232 <br /><br />Parts and Tools Used in this Video: <br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />TotalBoat 2:1 High Performance Epoxy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.totalboat.com/product/high-performance-21-epoxy-kits/">https://www.totalboat.com/product/high-performance-21-epoxy-kits/</a><br />TotalBoat Thickset Epoxy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.totalboat.com/product/totalboat-thickset-casting-epoxy/">https://www.totalboat.com/product/totalboat-thickset-casting-epoxy/</a><br />Vacuum Bagging Kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/product/product-detail/3773">https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/product/product-detail/3773</a><br />Vacuum Bagging Pump: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/product/product-detail/3755">https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/product/product-detail/3755</a><br />or use &quot;TBTotalXyla&quot; for 10% off the entire totalboat.com website{% endraw %}
