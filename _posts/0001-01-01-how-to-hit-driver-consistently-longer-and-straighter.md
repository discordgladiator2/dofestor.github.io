I started this YouTube channel to improve your golf game and to bring golfers together in a community. <br /><br />My main focus is to create relatable and funny golf content while helping to improve the golf game of the average golfer!

My channel features PGA Pro Lessons on how to Strike Your Irons Better, How to hit Long Distance Irons, Approach Shots and how to Draw or Fade your Golf Shot to get it Closer To The Hole. The Golfing Legend OMP shares Expert Golf Advice on Course Management, Chipping Perfectly and getting More Spin without thinning or duffing the shot. Top Golf tips on Golf Club choice and Golf Shot type. I also share lessons on How to Putt Better and how to Improve Putting Accuracy.<br /><br />I like to keep my content Fun, Friendly and Informative. I will test Golf Clubs and Golf Training Aids that people are interested in and provide a real, honest and accurate review of their performance. For entertainment purposes I try out Golf Accessories and Golf Products and see if they can improve my performance or if they are in fact just a ‘Fad’.<br /><br />If you would like to become a part of the most active golf community on YouTube please hit the subscribe button and the notification bell to never miss a video and keep yourself entertained with all your golfing needs!<br /><br />#Subscribe #HitTheBell #GolfMates{% endraw %}
