{% raw %}Arkansas' Charlie Welch, known to Razorbacks fans as Dr. Pinch Hit, comes off the bench once again to come through with a clutch hit.  This hit is a big three run homer that gives Arkansas a four run lead over Nebraska, 6/7/21.<br />Arkansas holds on for the win and a berth in the super regional this upcoming weekend vs. North Carolina St.<br />This video is the property of the NCAA.  I have no intentions of trying to profit off this video.  I just want to help give college baseball and players like Charlie Welch more exposure here on YouTube.{% endraw %}
