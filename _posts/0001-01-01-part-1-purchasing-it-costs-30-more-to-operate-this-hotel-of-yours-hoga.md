{% raw %}Season 4, Episode 22 - The Purchasing Plan<br /><br />I thought I uploaded this whole episode before, but it looks like I only did two or three parts.<br /><br />For yesterday's episode I remember what I was going to say: I just wanted to point out that look on Burkhalter's face in the final seconds of PART 5... I don't know if I've ever seen somebody portray a look of &quot;I am going to kill you&quot; on their face like that :) :) :) <br /><br />PART 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ssJ495iOiHQ">https://youtu.be/ssJ495iOiHQ</a><br />PART 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LlM-cOfB4lY">https://youtu.be/LlM-cOfB4lY</a><br />PART 3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mbGAMiaoX10">https://youtu.be/mbGAMiaoX10</a><br />PART 4: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Laj5xGMu7a4">https://youtu.be/Laj5xGMu7a4</a><br />PART 5: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rWqkuho1-tU">https://youtu.be/rWqkuho1-tU</a><br /><br />SUPPORT<br />As I can't monetize the channel and show no ads, it is support from the viewers that helps keep it going!
