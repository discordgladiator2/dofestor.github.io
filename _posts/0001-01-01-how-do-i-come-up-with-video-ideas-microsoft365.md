{% raw %}OneNote is my favorite software to use, and it saves me so much time to make my lists when I’m on my phone or laptop. They would still be connected and uploaded. I also like how it to be organized and helpful! For example, when I popped an idea for my YT video and I’d type in my phone to make a list. Till I get back home and look upon my laptop, adding more or go ahead filming. #Microsoft365 #ad <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aka.ms/Cheyenna365Home">https://aka.ms/Cheyenna365Home</a><br /><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA:<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: cheyenna clearbrook<br /><br />TWITTER: CheyClearbrook<br /><br />SNAPCHAT: lovergirlie45<br /><br /><br /><br />FOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES <br /><br />CONTACT ME:<br /><br />cheyenna.clearbrook@gmail.com<br /><br /><br /><br />if you are a company, looking for collaborations <br /><br />email me:<br /><br />cheyenna.clearbrook@gmail.com{% endraw %}
