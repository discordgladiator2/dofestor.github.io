{% raw %}I don't know how the heck else to title this lol <br /><br />LuLaRoe is, especially for plus size folks, just garbage. I bought a lot of it because I wanted comfy clothes and because when I was at my last job I had a huge need for retail therapy, but seriously, don't buy from them and don't be a consultant for them (or any other MLM scheme). <br /><br />In this video I compare a number of styles, focusing in particular on sizing discrepancies both within styles (Nicole, Madison) and between styles (Irma...honey why?). I also talk about quality issues (pilling, thin fabrics, etc.) and generally rant about MLM.<br /><br />Also my camera is not good shhhhh{% endraw %}
