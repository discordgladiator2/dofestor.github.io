{% raw %}The A.V. Alexandrov Russian army twice red-bannered academic song and dance ensemble. I first had this on vinyl over 40 years ago and went to see the Choir and Dancers in London in the early 1970s. This is the song that was used in Das Boot and was recorded by the Choir under the direction of Boris Alexandrov who was director from 1946 to 1987. It is therefore not a contemporary recording.<br /><br />It's a Long Way to Tipperary<br /><br />Up to mighty London came<br />An Irish lad one day,<br />All the streets were paved with gold,<br />So everyone was gay!<br />Singing songs of Piccadilly,<br />Strand, and Leicester Square,<br />'Til Paddy got excited and<br />He shouted to them there:<br /><br />It's a long way to Tipperary,<br />It's a long way to go.<br />It's a long way to Tipperary<br />To the sweetest girl I know!<br />Goodbye Piccadilly,<br />Farewell Leicester Square!<br />It's a long long way to Tipperary,<br />But my heart's right there.<br /><br />Paddy wrote a letter<br />To his Irish Molly O',<br />Saying, &quot;Should you not receive it,<br />Write and let me know!<br />If I make mistakes in &quot;spelling&quot;,<br />Molly dear&quot;, said he,<br />&quot;Remember it's the pen, that's bad,<br />Don't lay the blame on me&quot;.<br /><br />It's a long way to Tipperary,<br />It's a long way to go.<br />It's a long way to Tipperary<br />To the sweetest girl I know!<br />Goodbye Piccadilly,<br />Farewell Leicester Square,<br />It's a long long way to Tipperary,<br />But my heart's right there.<br /><br />Molly wrote a neat reply<br />To Irish Paddy O', <br />Saying, &quot;Mike Maloney wants <br />To marry me, and so <br />Leave the Strand and Piccadilly, <br />Or you'll be to blame, <br />For love has fairly drove me silly, <br />Hoping you're the same!&quot; <br /><br />It's a long way to Tipperary,<br />It's a long way to go.<br />It's a long way to Tipperary<br />To the sweetest girl I know!<br />Goodbye Piccadilly,<br />Farewell Leicester Square,<br />It's a long long way to Tipperary,<br />But my heart's right there.<br /><br />Extra wartime verse<br /><br />That's the wrong way to tickle Mary,<br />That's the wrong way to kiss!<br />Don't you know that over here, lad,<br />They like it best like this!<br />Hooray pour le Francais!<br />Farewell, Angleterre!<br />We didn't know the way to tickle Mary,<br />But we learned how, over there!{% endraw %}
