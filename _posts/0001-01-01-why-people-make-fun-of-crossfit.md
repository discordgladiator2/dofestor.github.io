{% raw %}Please take this video with a grain of salt. I was quite young when i made this, and take issue with how I handled the subject matter. My bias clearly shines through, and, because of this, you should not accept the ideas communicated. <br /><br />This is an old documentary made for media class. I really should have filmed more myself, but time constraints lead to this being mostly archive footage from the Internet.{% endraw %}
