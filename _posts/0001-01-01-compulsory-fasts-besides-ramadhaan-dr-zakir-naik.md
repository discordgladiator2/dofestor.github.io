{% raw %}Yusuf Chambers: Dr. Zakir, are there any other compulsory fasts other than the month of Ramadhaan that a Muslim must observe. <br /><br />Dr. Zakir: The fast can be broadly categorized into Fard fast that are obligatory and other is the ‘tatau’ fast i.e. the voluntary fast or the non-obligatory fast which InshaAllah we’ll be dealing may be on the episode 31. <br /><br />As far as the obligatory fast are concerned you can classify it under 4 types. <br /><br />The first as we are discussing the obligatory fast during the month of Ramadhaan. <br /><br />The second is if a person misses the fast of Ramadhaan for any reason, cover up the fast missed, its known as Qadha fast. <br />The third is fasting fro expiation of the sins. If you have committed a sin and you have to fast give a Kaffara. That is the third type. And the fourth is fasting if you are vowed to fast. So these are basically the 4 types of Fard fasting which are there in Islam. <br /><br />Yusuf Chambers: JazakAllah Khair! <br /><br />#DateWithDrZakir #CompulsoryFasts #besides #Ramadhaan<br />#Zakir  #Naik #ZakirNaik #DrZakirNaik #Allah #Allaah #God #Muslim #Islam #Islaam #Comparative #Religion #Comparativereligion #Atheism #Atheist #Christianity #Christian #Hinduism #Hindu #Buddhism #Buddhist #Judaism #Jew #Sikhism #Sikh #Jainism #Jain #Lecture #Question  #Answer #QuestionsandAnswer #Logic #Reason #Science #Misconception #Misunderstanding  #PeaceTV #Dawah #Muhammad #Mohammed #Hadeeth #Hadith #Saheeh #Sahih #Man #Woman #Human #Humanity #Problem #Solution #Rights #Media#War #Peace #Similarities  #Debate #Lecture  #Quran  #Quraan  #AlQuran #AlQuraan #Bible #Veda #Gita #Geeta #Baghwat  #Upanishad #Purana #Terrorism  #Terrorist #Universal #Brotherhood  #Word  #Purpose #Life  #Jihad  #Jihaad #Jesus #Christ #Jesuschrist #Church #Mosque #Masjid #Perspective  #Ask #AskDrZakir #Seeking #Knowledge #Education #NonMuslim #Fundamentalist  #Fundamentalism #Symposium  #Dialogue #Salaah #Salah #Shariah #Scripture  #Concept #West #Family #Global #Ramadhaan #Ramadan #Tauheed #Tawheed #Monotheism  #Zakaat #Zakat #Zakah  #Hajj #Saum #Fasting #Makkah #Mecca #Madinah #India  #Malaysia #Ummah #Unity #Importance #Date #Isamophobia #Understand  #Deen #Fardh #Fard  #Haraam #Haram #Sunnah #Mustahab #Waajib  #Wajib  #Compulsory  #Prohibited #Encouraged #Permissible  #Permitted #Prohibited<br /><br />RDD_EP_03_03{% endraw %}
