{% raw %}When a person's body temperature rises above 98.6°F (37°C), it is considered a fever. Fever by itself is not a disease but is an indication that your immune system is fighting an infection. But if your body temperature suddenly shoots up, you need to consult a doctor. However, if there is only a slight increase in temperature, certain remedies will gently soothe your fever.<br /><br />Drinking lots of water is the first step to cooling down your body's heat. In addition, drinking watered-down juice will also help in reducing your temperature. Watering down the juice is especially important as heavily concentrated juice can cause diarrhea. Another way to up your fluid intake is to drink tea. Green tea and ginger tea are especially beneficial when you have a fever.<br /><br />Cool compresses are an effective way to bring down the body's temperature quickly. If you start to feel extremely hot, apply a cool compress to the forehead, wrists, and calves while keeping the rest of the body covered. This will prevent your body's temperature from rising any higher. Replace these compresses with new ones and continue using them until the fever drops.<br /><br />It is a given that your appetite may go for a toss when you are running a fever. However, eating healthy and easily digestible foods is essential to supply your body with the energy and nutrients to fight infection. A bowl of soup, khichdi, curd rice, etc are a few of the many delicious options to help you recuperate. Remember these are just remedies to help make you feel more comfortable. It is always better to consult a doctor if your symptoms worsen. Never self medicate. <br /><br />Follow us for all the latest News &amp; Entertainment and to keep up-to date on all the happenings at ISH News: <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ISHNews/">https://www.facebook.com/ISHNews/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ishnews_tv">https://twitter.com/ishnews_tv</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ishnews/">https://www.instagram.com/ishnews/</a> <br />Official Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ishnews.tv/">http://www.ishnews.tv/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!!
