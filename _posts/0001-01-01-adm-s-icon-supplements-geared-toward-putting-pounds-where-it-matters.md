{% raw %}It’s hard enough to make ends meet today. What would another 30 pounds per head mean for your operation? <br /><br />About ADM Animal Nutrition:<br /><br /><br /><br />ADM Animal Nutrition, a division of  Archer Daniels Midland Company, is a leading producer of livestock feed ingredients. From grain selection to processing, packaging and delivery, we control every step to ensure a consistent, quality product.<br /><br /><br /><br />ADM Animal Nutrition is composed of what were once several independent livestock feed companies. Most notable of those companies were MoorMan's®, Consolidated Nutrition®, SuperSweet®, Master Mix®, and Tindle Feeds®. The roots of some of these companies trace back to the late 1800's with a focus on improving livestock feed to help enrich America's food supply. In January of 2002 these companies, under the ADM umbrella, were unified to form one ADM operating feed division, ADM Animal Nutrition.<br /><br /><br /><br />Each ADM product is specifically created to help producers meet the nutritional demands of modern livestock while balancing environmental concerns.{% endraw %}
