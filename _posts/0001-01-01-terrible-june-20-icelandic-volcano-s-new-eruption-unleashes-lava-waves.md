{% raw %}Terrible: Icelandic volcano's new eruption unleashes lava waves that trap 75,000 tourists<br /><br />A government working group believes that the volcano will be the new hot tourist destination in Iceland and therefore proposes that there should be a small parking fee at the new car park near the eruption. It is estimated that 75,000 people have visited the area since the eruption began almost seven weeks ago, without significant accidents.<br /><br />“It costs a lot to set up these car parks, permanent car parks. This is now temporary inside the areas, proposed by landowners. And it may be charged a modest parking fee for operating it,” says Fannar Jónasson, mayor of Grindavík<br /><br />He goes on to say: “Landowners are also considering setting up service facilities there, toilets, an information center and facilities for those who work in the area. This is one of the things that is in full swing.”Fannar also said they are putting infrastructure in place to help ensure the safety of visitors.{% endraw %}
