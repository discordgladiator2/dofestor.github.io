{% raw %}This Mass Effect 3 Easter egg was put in the game 10 years ago and was just revealed recently as no one had found how to trigger it after all these years. I am currently playing through mass effect legendary edition and I'm really enjoying it, This was a nice Easter egg to come across.<br /><br />The Easter Egg can be found at the start of the mars mission in mass effect 3. You have to walk specific route around the solar panels to spawn the mars rover Easter egg. <br /><br />Subscribe ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2TsLCVJ">http://bit.ly/2TsLCVJ</a><br /><br />► Use Epic Creator Code: xGarbett<br />►Become a Channel Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVH6TnazTWF3KQTVug4905Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVH6TnazTWF3KQTVug4905Q/join</a><br /><br />● Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/xGarbett">https://twitter.com/xGarbett</a><br />● Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/jjcNk95">https://discord.gg/jjcNk95</a><br />● Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/xGarbett">http://facebook.com/xGarbett</a><br />● Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/xGarbett">https://www.twitch.tv/xGarbett</a><br />● Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://xgarbett.com/">https://xgarbett.com/</a><br /><br />#MassEffect #EasterEgg{% endraw %}
