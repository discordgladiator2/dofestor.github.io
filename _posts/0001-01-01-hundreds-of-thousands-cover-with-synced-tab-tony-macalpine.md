{% raw %}Share &quot;Hundreds Of Thousands&quot; ! (Tony MacAlpine) with Synced Tab!! Thanks to my dear friends from Guitar Pro by Arobas Music. I put some important fingerings as it is something you rarely see on a tab, and it matters to me. It is not as perfect and clear as the original track (that I encourage you to listen) but it's fun to play! I hope it will help &amp; please you.{% endraw %}
