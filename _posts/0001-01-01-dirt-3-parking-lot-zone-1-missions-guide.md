My advice is begin up against the fence for maximum distance to the ramp for greater speed and therefore greater time in the air. Use your handbrake and turn full lock in one direction just before leaving the ramp. If you land on the flat part of the ramp, you probably wont complete the mission.<br /><br />720p HD Available!{% endraw %}
