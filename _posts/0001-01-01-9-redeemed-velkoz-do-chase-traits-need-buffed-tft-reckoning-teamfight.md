{% raw %}This game we managed to pull off one of the tougher chase traits to get, 9 Redeemed! We do it with amazing items on our Velkoz, and an awesome Redeemed Teemo 2 to back him up. BUT UNFORTUNATELY we were up against the ruiner of fun, another @#$%ING Hecarim. So who wins this round? The Level 9 chase trait? or the insanely OP 2 cost?
