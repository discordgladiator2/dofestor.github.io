{% raw %}What is the volatile keyword in C, and how does it work?<br /><br />Some of you for a video about &quot;volatile&quot;— a keyword that concerns and mystifies a lot of beginning programming students. I hope this video demystifies it for you, with some simple examples.<br /><br />Related Videos:<br />Threads (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA8X5zNOGw8)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA8X5zNOGw8)</a><br />Signals (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83M5-NPDeWs)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83M5-NPDeWs)</a><br />Optimizations (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U161zVjv1rs)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U161zVjv1rs)</a> <br /><br /><br />**** Sponsor Offer ****<br />Register to get $100 free coupon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nextpcb.com?code=Jacob">https://www.nextpcb.com?code=Jacob</a><br /><br />Double side PCB assembly free shipping:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nextpcb.com/pcb-assembly-services?code=Jacob">https://www.nextpcb.com/pcb-assembly-services?code=Jacob</a><br /><br /><br />Free PCB Design Analysis Software:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nextpcb.com/nextdfm.html?code=Jacob">https://www.nextpcb.com/nextdfm.html?code=Jacob</a><br />****<br /><br />Welcome to my channel.. I post videos that help you learn to program and become a more confident software developer. I cover beginner-to-advanced systems topics ranging from network programming, threads, processes, operating systems, embedded systems and others. My goal is to help you get under-the-hood and better understand how computers work and how you can use them to become stronger students and more capable professional developers.<br /><br />About me: I'm a computer scientist, electrical engineer, researcher, and teacher. I specialize in embedded systems, mobile computing, sensor networks, and the Internet of Things. I teach systems and networking courses at Clemson University, where I also lead the PERSIST research lab. <br /><br />More about me and what I do:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jacobsorber.com">https://www.jacobsorber.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~jsorber/">https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~jsorber/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://persist.cs.clemson.edu/">http://persist.cs.clemson.edu/</a><br /><br />To Support the Channel:<br />+ like, subscribe, spread the word<br />+ contribute via Patreon --- [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jacobsorber]">https://www.patreon.com/jacobsorber]</a><br />+ rep the channel with nerdy merch --- [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/jacob-sorbers-store]">https://teespring.com/stores/jacob-sorbers-store]</a><br /><br />Source code is also available to Patreon supporters. --- [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jsorber-youtube-source.herokuapp.com/]">https://jsorber-youtube-source.herokuapp.com/]</a><br />Note: I haven't posted ALL of the code from ALL of my videos yet.
