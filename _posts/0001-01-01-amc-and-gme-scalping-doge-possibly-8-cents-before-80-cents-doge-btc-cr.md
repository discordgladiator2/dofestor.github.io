Meaning, social media users collectively drove the stock prices<br />up, forcing short sellers who bet the stock price would go down, to purchase shares at an<br />increased price. Reddit user, Keith Gill, notoriously discussed GameStop stock on Reddit under<br />the username ‚ÄúDeepF*ckingValue.‚Äù Initially, this squeeze led to heavy losses for some short<br />sellers, particularly hedge funds, and led to substantial financial gain for some retail investors.<br />Robinhood, and other broker dealers, placed restrictions on transactions in these stocks, which<br />received public and regulatory scrutiny. Eventually, the stock prices started to decline and many<br />investors were faced with steep financial losses. For some, the January short squeeze raises<br />questions regarding whether legislators and regulators should take a closer look at existing rules<br />governing short sales and related disclosures, as well as the conflicts between the practice of<br />payment for order flow and firms‚Äô best execution obligations. It also raises important questions<br />about the efficacy of anti-market manipulation laws and whether technology and social media<br />have outpaced regulation in a manner that leaves investors and the markets exposed to<br />unnecessary risks.<br />II.
