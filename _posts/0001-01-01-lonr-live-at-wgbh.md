{% raw %}Lonr. performs an acoustic set at WGBH's Fraser Performance Studio in Boston. Lonr. moved from Los Angeles to Cape Cod, Massachusetts as a kid and as a result felt out of place. He entrenched himself in beat-making, creating his own universe in music. Inspired by the likes of Pharrell, OutKast, and Tyler, The Creator as well as film scores for Star Wars and Interstellar he developed his production and songwriting talents. By 2019, he found himself up for multiple Grammy Awards for his contributions to H.E.R’s discography, winning two. Lonr. stands for, Land of Nothing Real. <br /><br />Session recorded 2/13/20 <br />  <br />Set list:<br />Safe Zone 0:08<br />Unruly 2:55<br />A.M. 5:32<br />The End 8:17<br />  <br />More about Lonr. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/1lonr/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/1lonr/?hl=en</a><br /> <br />Subscribe to WGBH's YouTube Channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=WGBHMusic">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=WGBHMusic</a><br /> <br />Join the Front Row Boston email list: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wgbh.org/newsletters/front-row-boston">https://www.wgbh.org/newsletters/front-row-boston</a><br />FRB web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wgbh.org/music">https://www.wgbh.org/music</a><br />WGBH’s NPR Music Live Sessions channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://livesessions.npr.org/happening/boston">https://livesessions.npr.org/happening/boston</a><br /> <br />Video Credits:<br />Stacy Buchanan – Producer<br />Joel Watts – Audio Recording &amp; Mix<br />Greg Shea – Director/Camera/Editor<br />Meghan Smith – Slider<br />Nolan Yee – Camera{% endraw %}
