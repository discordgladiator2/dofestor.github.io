{% raw %}Mayfair, London.<br /><br /><br /><br />Two fashion designers - the Ravis (sp?) sisters - admire their handiwork as three women model some of their creations.  The Degas painting &quot;The Dancing Class&quot; is on display as the narrator explains that all these fashions have been inspired by &quot;old master&quot; paintings.  Models stand in front of a large picture frame as they pose.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The sisters make notes and compare their creations with the paintings that have inspired them.  Davide (?) and Gaugin inspire the second gown - a draped chiffon number with a head-dress of orange feathers.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The Ravis sisters believe that only women can design clothes for women.  They concentrate on clothes that are essentially beautiful, feminine and wearable.  The third outfit (modelled by an Alma Cogan lookalike) was inspired by a painting called &quot;Magnolias&quot; by a 19th century Russian artist - Tretchikoff (sp?).  The empire style bust line of an Ingres (?) painting has inspired another dress - a bright pink number.  <br /><br /><br /><br />A Petros Christos (sp?) painting has inspired a cocktail dress and hat, worn by a dark skinned model (unusual at this time perhaps, a black model?).  A pink evening dress with a bouffant skirt has been inspired by a Renoir painting.  Three models pose together as &quot;The Three Graces&quot; in gorgeous silk gowns with ornate embroidery.  C/Us of each of the girls and dresses then camera pans down to prints of &quot;old masters&quot; laid out on the floor.      <br /><br /><br /><br />Note: these are fabulous, extravagant outfits - totally desirable and wonderful!<br /> FILM ID:83.05<br /><br />A VIDEO FROM BRITISH PATHÉ.
