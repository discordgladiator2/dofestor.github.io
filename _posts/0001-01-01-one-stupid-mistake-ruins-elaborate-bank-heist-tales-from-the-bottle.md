{% raw %}Just imagine - you spend months meticulously planning a bank robbery and the perfect getaway. Then you end up in jail anyway thanks to random circumstance.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Anthony J. Curcio (born September 1, 1980) is an American author, public speaker, and convicted robber. In 2008, Curcio was responsible for one of the most elaborately planned armored car heists in U.S. history. He was eventually arrested and sentenced to six years in federal prison. Upon his release from prison he has devoted his life to working with youth in the field of drug abuse and crime prevention, speaking to students and athletes across the U.S. He has been featured in GQ, Esquire, 20/20, Fox News, NPR and NBC among others.&quot;<br /><br />More on Wikipedia: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Curcio">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Curcio</a><br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/qxir">https://teespring.com/stores/qxir</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/qxir">https://www.patreon.com/qxir</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/QxirYT">https://twitter.com/QxirYT</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/jZzvvwJ">https://discord.gg/jZzvvwJ</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/qxiryt/">https://www.twitch.tv/qxiryt/</a><br />Subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Qxir/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Qxir/</a>{% endraw %}
