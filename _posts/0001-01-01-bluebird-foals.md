{% raw %}Ripped from my purchased copy of My Number 7&quot; vinyl RSD LIMITED Special Edition. Sharing it, as there is now other way for people to purchase it.<br />I do not own this song, it belongs to its rightful owners. No copyright infringement intended.<br /><br />Please purchase 'Holy Fire' from Foals on iTunes to support the band (plus it's a helluva album). <br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />I know I've made this journey before<br />And still it's not what I'd hoped for<br /><br />I wait in this storm, way after dark<br />'Cause you left your keys in the lock of my heart<br />The closer we get, the further apart<br /><br />What's left of me? What's left of you?<br />You pull me around, sweetly shine on<br />You're milk in my veins, sand in my shoes<br />And I know now, I'll be there for you{% endraw %}
