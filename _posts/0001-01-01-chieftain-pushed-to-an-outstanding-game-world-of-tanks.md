It was planned to provide for the armament interchangeability of the FV4201 Chieftain and the American T95 tanks (including turrets). The project was discontinued because of issues with crew training, as the members of the vehicle crew would have had to operate two different artillery and gun control systems at once.<br /><br />Battle Stats:<br />TheCAH9I [KIEB]<br />T95/FV4201 Chieftain<br />Map Berlin<br />Damage: 11507<br />Frags: 8<br />Blocked damage: 3490<br /><br />Medals: 14<br />Master, Hand of God, Bruiser, Duelist, Fire for Effect, Shellproof, Radley Walters, Fadins, KolobanovÂ´s, Pascucci, Confederate, High Caliber, Steel Wall, Warrior,<br /><br />Mods used for the replay recordings: aslains modpack from wgmods(dot)net<br />World of Tanks{% endraw %}
