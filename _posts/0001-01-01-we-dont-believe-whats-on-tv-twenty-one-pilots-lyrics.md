{% raw %}Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!<br />We don't believe what's on tv<br />Because it's what we want to see<br />And what we want we know we can't believe<br />We have all learned to kill our dreams<br /><br />I need to know<br />That when I fail you'll still be here<br />Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds<br />And we'll make money selling your hair<br />I don't care what's in your hair<br />I just wanna know what's on your mind<br />I used to say I wanna die before I'm old<br />But because of you I might think twice<br />Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!<br /><br />(Alright, second verse!)<br />What if my dream does not happen?<br />Would I just change what I've told my friends?<br />Don't want to know who I would be<br />When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep<br />I need to know<br />That when I fail you'll still be here<br />Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds<br />And we'll make money selling your hair<br /><br />I don't care what's in your hair<br />I just wanna know what's on your mind<br />I used to say I wanna die before I'm old<br />But because of you I might think twice<br />Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!{% endraw %}
