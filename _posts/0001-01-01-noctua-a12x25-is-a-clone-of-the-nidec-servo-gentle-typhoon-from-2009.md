{% raw %}In a past video we pitted the Thermaltake tough fan 12 vs the Noctua A12x25. However after that video went live many of you said, dont hate Thermaltake for using the same design, Noctua did the same thing to the Gentle Typhoon from 2009. The Nidec Servo Gentle Typhoon was a fan I never heard of but, its still available to buy so I picked one up to test out and was surprised at how well a fan from almost 10 years ago does when compared to a fan some call the best.<br /><br />Nidec Servo Gentle Typhoon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qayP7p">https://amzn.to/3qayP7p</a><br /><br />Noctua A12x25<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TP1suw">https://amzn.to/2TP1suw</a><br /><br />Thermaltake Toughfan 12<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TP1um8">https://amzn.to/2TP1um8</a>{% endraw %}
