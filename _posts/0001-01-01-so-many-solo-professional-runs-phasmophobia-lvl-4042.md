{% raw %}In this video I play Phasmophobia completely normal, no challenges, just a bunch of relaxing solo professional runs. I don't usually tend to upload my very &quot;normal&quot; runs to YouTube, so let me know if you want to see more of this in the future! I would love to make a &quot;relaxing&quot; series out of this! We had some really fun ghosts and a few really hard ones as well! I hope you enjoy, much love and see you during the streams :D<br /><br />I stream every day live at 7PM CEST, 1PM EST, 10AM PST over on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/insym">https://www.twitch.tv/insym</a><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/InsymTtv">https://twitter.com/InsymTtv</a><br />Join the community discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/insym">https://discord.gg/insym</a><br /><br />NOTE: This video was recorded on Phasmophobia update v0.28.6.5{% endraw %}
