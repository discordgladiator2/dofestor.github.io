{% raw %}We find our favorite kind of anchorage. The kind with no one around and nothing to be heard but fish jumping, birds chirping, and the occasional Jetty bark üòÇ I have been wanting to dive for so long and we finally get the perfect weather and we are able to bring back dinner. Take it from us NOTHING compares<br />to fresh caught fish for dinner‚Ä¶. <br /><br />Thanks so much for watching! <br /><br />You can find out  more info about the Corsair 880 Trimaran here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Corsair880TES">https://bit.ly/Corsair880TES</a><br /><br />Do you want your very own Tula gear?
