Demonstrating a surprising depth of knowledge, a security guard politely fields a wide array of questions as people visit Wassily Kandinsky’s oil painting ‘Dramatic and Mild’ (1932). Building its own mood – one of charm and small surprises – this film invites its audience to contemplate any number of questions about what it means to bear witness to art.{% endraw %}
