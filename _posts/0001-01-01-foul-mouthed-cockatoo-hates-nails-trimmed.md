{% raw %}Pebble the cockatoo is one of the stars of her owner’s YouTube channel, which has featured videos of the bird’s various mood swings. This video shows Pebble in one of her bad moods, after her owner decided to trim her nails. Pebble was not impressed, and used some very foul language to get her point across!<br /><br />Credit: YouTube/MegaBirdCrazy<br />Original Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsLmQF29OgU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsLmQF29OgU</a><br /><br />———<br />For Storyful Newswire subscription inquiries, please contact sales@storyful.com<br /><br />To license a video for editorial use please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://video.storyful.com">https://video.storyful.com</a><br /> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/storyful">https://twitter.com/storyful</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Storyful">https://www.facebook.com/Storyful</a>{% endraw %}
