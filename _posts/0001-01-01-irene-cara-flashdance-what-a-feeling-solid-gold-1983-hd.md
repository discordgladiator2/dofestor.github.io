{% raw %}This was a 'live' TV performance on Solid Gold. Like many of the TV shows in the 80's, it was actually lip-synching. I remixed with stereo music and made some visual enhancements. <br /><br />***The tape was originally ripped and dubbed by a friend Anthony Ochoa some years ago, and many thanks to him.{% endraw %}
