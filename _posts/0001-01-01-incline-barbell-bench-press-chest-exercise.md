Place your feet firmly on the floor or on a step platform. <br /><br />- With your lower back slightly arched, grab the bar using a larger-than-shoulder-width grip. <br /><br />- Then, lift the bar from the rack and hold it directly over your upper chest with your arms extended. This is the starting position.<br /><br />(First Movement) <br /><br />- Now, inhale as you slowly lower the bar to your chest by bending your elbows and bringing your arms back toward the bench. <br /><br />(Second Movement)<br /><br />- Exhale as you use your upper pec muscles to press the weights back up to the starting positon. <br /><br />(Extra tips)<br /><br />- Make sure to keep your chest lifted and your shoulder blades pinned to the bench throughout the entire exercise. <br /><br />- When you finish your reps, carefully place the bar back on the rack. If necessary, ask someone to spot you during this exercise.{% endraw %}
