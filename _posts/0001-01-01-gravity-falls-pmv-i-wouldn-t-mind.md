{% raw %}**CONTAINED EPISODES SPOILERS &amp; AGED UP CHARACTERS**<br /><br />====================================================<br /><br />EDIT 05/17/17: OMG IT REACHED 100K VIEWS !!! THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM SO HONORED !!! All of your lovely comments encouraged me so much~~!!! <br /><br />I see some comments says that grown up Gideon looks like Viktor and Jack Frost and ask if I got my inspiration from them. The answer is no, Gideon's grown up design is something I came up by myself. I kept his original hairstyle with a little hair fall down on his forehead just to show the mature features on him, so don't worry I'm not copying anyone at this point I can guarantee.<br /><br />====================================================<br /><br />Mabel: &quot;I'm still friendzoning you ヾ(＾∇＾)&quot;<br />Gideon: &quot;(*꒦ິ꒳꒦ີ)&quot;<br /><br />====================================================<br /><br />This is my first time doing a PMV I hope it turns out okay~<br />A Magidbeleon (Gideon &amp; Mabel) Tribute.<br />Related comic can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tanosan96.tumblr.com/post/153169916237/i-was-lazy-to-draw-a-full-color-one-dont-mind-me">http://tanosan96.tumblr.com/post/153169916237/i-was-lazy-to-draw-a-full-color-one-dont-mind-me</a><br /><br />All the art in the PMV belongs to me, backgrounds are redrawn by me also.<br />Gravity Falls &amp; Characters belongs to Alex Hirsch.<br /><br />Please do not repost on anywhere.{% endraw %}
