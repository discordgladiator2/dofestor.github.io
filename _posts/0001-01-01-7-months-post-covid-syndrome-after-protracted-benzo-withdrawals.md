{% raw %}Its been 7 months since I contracted Covid.  I have been the sickest Ive been in years and this is the longest I've ever felt so bad.  The doctors really don't know what to do and medications are hit and miss and that doesnâ€™t work with me due to pre existing medical harm from pharmaceuticals.{% endraw %}
