{% raw %}Doctor Explains Pitcher Dies After Tommy John Surgery<br /><br />Sang Ho Baek, a pitcher for George Mason University, required Tommy John surgery. Sang Ho Baek died from complications with the surgery at only 20 years old. Tommy John's surgery, or ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, repairs a torn ligament in the elbow. It's a routine procedure that rarely leads to complications. After the surgery, he developed a blood clot in his lungs, aka a pulmonary embolism, leading to his death. <br /><br />Here is his GoFundMe page: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/sang-ho-baek-memoriam-fundraiser">https://www.gofundme.com/f/sang-ho-baek-memoriam-fundraiser</a><br /><br />Doctor Mike Hansen, MD<br />Internal Medicine | Pulmonary Disease | Critical Care Medicine<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://doctormikehansen.com/">https://doctormikehansen.com/</a><br />IG Account: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/">http://instagram.com/doctor.hansen/</a><br />FB Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen">https://www.facebook.com/DoctorMikeHansen</a>{% endraw %}
