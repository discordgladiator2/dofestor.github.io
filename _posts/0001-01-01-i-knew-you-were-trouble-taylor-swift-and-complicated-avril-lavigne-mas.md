{% raw %}I knew you were complicated...<br /><br />Here is another Complicated mashup, and I hope you like it. I wanted to wait a couple of days before I posted another video, but I decided that now would be the best time. Enjoy the music. And please, no hate, I've worked really hard on this, so don't judge me for what I'm doing.<br /><br />Instrumental: I Knew You Were Trouble<br />Acapella: Complicated<br /><br />No copyright infringement intended.
