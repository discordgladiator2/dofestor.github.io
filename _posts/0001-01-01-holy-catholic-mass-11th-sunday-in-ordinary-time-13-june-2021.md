{% raw %}Instead of comparing the kingdom of God to something grand like the cedar tree, Jesus likens it to a mustard seed. The Church is filled with both saints and sinners. And though imperfect, through the mystery of God, it will grow â€” just as how the Church grew from a seemingly motley band of apostles. So, no matter how small our acts or contributions seem to be, they are llike seeds, which play a part in the growing of the kingdom. <br /><br />Do share this with your loved ones and let us grow in faith together.<br /><br />Support us in our efforts: <br /> <br />St Mary of the Angels:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://give.stmary.sg/">https://give.stmary.sg/</a> <br /> <br />Franciscan Friars:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://franciscans.sg/support-us/">http://franciscans.sg/support-us/</a> <br /> <br />Special thanks to the contribution of: <br />Franciscan Friars from St Anthony Custody in Singapore &amp; Malaysia (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.franciscans.sg)">http://www.franciscans.sg)</a>  <br />The following ministries of St Mary of the Angels:<br />Franciscan Digital Ministry<br />Lectors Ministry<br />Luminaire Ministry<br />Music Ministry{% endraw %}
