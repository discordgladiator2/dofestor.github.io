{% raw %}This yoga practice guides you through a series of poses to balance the root chakra and cultivate grounding with gratitude. When the root chakra, or Muladhara, is out of balance a person can feel anxious, uneasy, fearful, worried and stressed. This can lead to low energy and low immunity and an overall sense of instability. Use the tools of yoga to strengthen and balance to the root chakra, the foundation of all the other chakras.
