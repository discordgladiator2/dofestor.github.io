{% raw %}Hi! This another wlw song, I hope you like it! I also have original music on all streaming platforms :)<br /><br />Instagram/Tiktok: @emmaorourkemusic<br /><br />LYRICS:<br />They say that sapphics fall in love too quickly <br />They see us move in and say “it’s so risky”<br />But can you blame us when we spent so long<br />Thinking everything about our love was wrong?<br /><br />Sat on the bathroom floor the day I realised <br />And the thought of coming out had me terrified <br />Cause what if no one said that it was okay?<br />And what if no girl ever took me on a date?<br /><br />So yeah, I say I love you too soon<br />It’s been three dates, but she says it too <br />Some cliché, like a honeymoon <br />Cause this feeling is long overdue <br /><br />When I’m with her I don’t hear the whispers  <br />Like everyone disappears when I kiss her <br />Why wouldn’t I hold onto something so good?<br />I swear I didn’t know my heart could feel this much<br /><br />I wish I could go back and tell that scared girl<br />She wouldn’t always want to hide from the world <br />Wrote in her diary that she’s better off alone <br />But now I sit straight up like I’m on a throne <br /><br />So yeah I say I love you too soon<br />It’s been three dates, but she says it too <br />Some cliche, like a honeymoon <br />Cause this feeling is long overdue <br /><br />And I know that there’s no guarantee<br />But you don’t see what I see <br />You say it’s foolish, I disagree <br />I think it’s going beautifully{% endraw %}
