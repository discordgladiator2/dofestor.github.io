{% raw %}This video demonstrates setting up, using, and the putting down of the Pamela R Johnson lap easel, sold on eBay. It’s so easy to use and lightweight to pack in your rucksack or suitcase ready to take with you when you go anywhere painting! I’ve even used it sitting in the house in front of the tTV following a demonstration from another artist. I love painting outdoors, and with this easel you can be comfortable sitting down, you don’t have to worry about spilling your water, it’s so sturdy when it’s tightened securely around your legs, some foam on the base for protecting your legs. I use a coated apron, for added protection from little painting mishaps. I could never find the perfect easel, so eventually designed this one and it’s fabulous!{% endraw %}
