{% raw %}This drop-in pack solves many problems for 200 Series owners: minimise weight and get if as far forward as possible, keep rear seats and cargo barrier, no modification to inside the vehicle. Then you get: double induction, espresso machine, 60L fridge, big prep area, and an even bigger storage area on top with ease of access. All powered from 600Ah Lithium, 5,000W inverter and Scotty: up to 3,000W from the 250A upgraded alternator. If you hear negativity on 48V systems, then they are “flat earthers”. 48V and electric kitchens are the future off road. <br />Fitting this out involves automotive, interior and electrical design. A trio of skills rare to most auto shops. “Espresso79 and Safiery” collaborated with “Black Label Storage” for a Signature Build Team with these skills. Each job is “Truly Unique”. This is the largest power system we have built in a 200 Series which is an exceptional outcome in sustainable power.  It will be in the back of Darrell Maher’s 2021 model for his upcoming big trip. 5,000W Inverter, 600Ah Lithium and Scotty capable of 3,000W replenishment from the alternator. Portable solar will pump in up to 300W. Complete with GPS and 4G Modem for Safiery’s Gold Online support, critical alerts like low battery are notified to Safiery 24/7. We build complete packages and ship them to you. You may need a local  sparky to hook up the alternator cables. Thats all.  We commission on line and the best part: with our Gold Support online we monitor and assist 24/7.<br />These Signature Kits are the work of Andrew @espresso_seventy9 and Safiery. Andrew has the touch for perfection and Bruce guides on the tech side. If you want the best power pack that both looks awesome and packs a punch, PM Andrew or email us at Safiery. @blacklabelstorage #howgoodsthat #traveltheworld #withoutconsumingtheearth #LC200 #landcruiser200series #scotty{% endraw %}
