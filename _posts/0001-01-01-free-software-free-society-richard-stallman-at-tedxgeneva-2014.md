{% raw %}It is the first TEDx talk of the founder of Free Software movement. Stallman, RMS for short, has changed the world with his vision of freedom for the digital age. He launched the GNU operating system, used with Linux as a component, and inspired the development of Creative Commons licences and Wikipedia project. In this talk, Stallman describes how nonfree programs give companies control of their users and what users can do in order to recover control over their computing.<br /><br />Licence: Creative Commons BY-SA-ND 3.0<br /><br />CREDITS :<br />Drawings under CC-BY-ND 3.0 created by Christian Nogareda (Kwis, H<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ttp://kwis.tumblr.com)">ttp://kwis.tumblr.com)</a> &amp; Valentin Pasquier (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://utopiqdream.deviantart.com)">http://utopiqdream.deviantart.com)</a> based on ideas of  Richard Stallman, by himself &amp; Ynternet.org foundation.<br /><br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
