{% raw %}&quot;Daifuku FADA's India journey started in 2014. In a short span, we have become the leader in Indian ASRS market; all of the systems installed were Pallet Load ASRS. We now have reached another milestone, where we are deploying our fist ever Miniload ASRS in India. Its truly a monumental time and gives us great pride and humility to have such opportunities to serve the client and society at large. We in our way are contributing to MAKE IN INDIA!&quot;{% endraw %}
