{% raw %}In this video, I'm going to discuss my impressions of the build process of the Ooznest Workbee.  Here's a link to the CNC.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ooznest.store/MCWorkBee">https://ooznest.store/MCWorkBee</a>  Do I think you should buy an Ooznest Workbee?  I was given this machine to review and was told to give my honest opinion.  Had I felt the need to rip this company and machine apart it's likely I wouldn't have posted this video.  The company would have had to really gone out of their way to leave a bad impression for me to post a negative review video.  I prefer to share products on this channel that I have a high opinion of.  This CNC happens to be one of them.  <br /><br />The build process is extensive and initially, I was a little overwhelmed at just how many bags of parts were in the boxes.  That said once I started getting into the build I found it to be a really pleasurable experience.  The directions and guides that not only come with it are great, but there is also additional info here including videos.  Step by step videos.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.ooznest.co.uk/c/WorkBee_CNC_Machine">https://learn.ooznest.co.uk/c/WorkBee_CNC_Machine</a>  <br /><br />Affiliate Links:<br />Best Router For small CNC's  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2rbbCaT">https://amzn.to/2rbbCaT</a><br />Best Bit for Leveling Waste Board  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2qzLt5w">https://amzn.to/2qzLt5w</a><br /><br /><br />#cnc #ooznest #cncrouter{% endraw %}
