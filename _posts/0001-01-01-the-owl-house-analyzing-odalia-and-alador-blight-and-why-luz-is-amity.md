{% raw %}The Owl House season 2 episode 2 Escaping Expulsion gave us our first proper look at the Blight parents! I talk about their behaviour and the mentality behind it, as well as why Luz is the perfect candidate to save Amity because I'm Lumity trash, baby! <br /><br />Dana Terrace, why did you choose to make them so hot but so evil? Truly, you are the real series antagonist... Hoping this season also goes into Emira and Edric a little more as well. As soon as that happens, rest assured I'll be dropping a video on 'em! Also, would you guys be interested in a review of these eps? Let me know!<br /><br />Subscribe for more Owl House content, and see you next time for episode 3, Echoes of The Past!{% endraw %}
