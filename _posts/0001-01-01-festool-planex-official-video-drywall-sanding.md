{% raw %}The Festool PLANEX Drywall Sander is a virtually dust-free drywall sanding solution when coupled with Festool's CT 36 AutoClean Dust Extractor. Its longer lasting, less expensive sanding abrasives reduce operating costs and total cost of ownership. A modular design allows the unit to be collapsed in size for spaces ranging from hallways to full rooms to high ceilings. Likewise, the PLANEX can be extended for high walls and ceilings. Made in Germany quality with a robust design guarantees years of reliable service backed by a three year warranty. Variable suction allows the PLANEX to virtually support its own weight reducing fatigue.{% endraw %}
