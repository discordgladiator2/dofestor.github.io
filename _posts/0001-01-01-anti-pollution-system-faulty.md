{% raw %}Citroen C4 By Loeb 2010 1,6 THP.  Anti-Pollution system faulty! Engine power loss. Error codes: P2191 and P0132. This engine and turbo has only driven 40 000km. Randomly gives full power back but most of the time no power at all. Engine sound is normal but in cold start + cold engine sound metallic/diesel. I filmed the part which has changed dark black on the engine bay.{% endraw %}
