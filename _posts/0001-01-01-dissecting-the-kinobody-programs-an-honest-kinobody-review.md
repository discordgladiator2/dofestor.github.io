{% raw %}In this video I give a full and an honest Kinobody review. I give you a complete kinobody program review, covering the greek god and superhero bulking programs- speaking on both the strengths and the weakness of the programs- covering the areas of exercise selection, volume, progression scheme, his strength standards, and testimonial commentary.<br /><br />I do want to make it clear that I did the Kinobody Greek God Program for a full 2 years before having to switch my training to make continual progress. Also, I am not trying to hate on Greg O'Gallagher or the Kinobody brand, this video is simply a review of his programs from the perspective of building strength and muscle.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video, and remember to send it with a friend! Also feel free to tag Greg himself or send this to him! I'd love to see his counter argument lol. <br /><br />Time Stamps:<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:35 Exercise Selection (Incline Bench)<br />04:13 Exercise Selection (Weighted Chin-up)<br />05:25 Exercise Selection (Leg Training)<br />08:54 Volume<br />13:52 Strength Standards<br />17:51 Testimonial Commentary<br />19:06 Final Thoughts/Observations{% endraw %}
