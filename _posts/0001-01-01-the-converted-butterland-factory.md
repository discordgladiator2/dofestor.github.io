{% raw %}The Converted is our new series about innovative homes that have been created, or converted, from unlikely places. From butter factories to churches, The Converted will show you that almost anything can become a home. <br /><br />Ever wondered what it might be like to live in an old factory? In this episode, we take a look at a gorgeous converted butter factory, situated in Newstead in Victoria’s shire of Mount Alexander. Constructed in 1904, the building was once the main dairy supplier for the surrounding region. Now, it has been renovated into a beautiful home for couple Greg Hatton and Katie Marx.<br /><br />Living in the inner suburbs of Melbourne, Greg found the old factory on realestate.com.au and immediately saw the potential for it to be transformed into a home for them and their family.<br /><br />Starting in 2010, the process of converting the space was difficult and laborious,  but the couple say that their work has paid off.<br /><br />They wanted to make sure that they did not overdo the renovation, and that they kept the building as much in its original condition as they could—maintaining its rustic, rural beauty.<br /><br />Katie and Greg take us through highlights of the building, from the visible beams in the ceiling, to the use of local river gravel to construct the walls. The couple see their home as a community resource, and the space is now used to host events and workshops.<br /><br />The converted butter factory shows us the beauty of rural living, and how old spaces can become new with a little love and attention.<br /><br />Read more about Katie and Greg’s stunning home: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.realestate.com.au/lifestyle/episode-one-butterland-factory-conversion-hits-the-sweet-spot/">https://www.realestate.com.au/lifestyle/episode-one-butterland-factory-conversion-hits-the-sweet-spot/</a><br /><br />Discover more amazing converted homes on our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.realestate.com.au/lifestyle/dream-homes/the-converted/">https://www.realestate.com.au/lifestyle/dream-homes/the-converted/</a><br /><br />Don’t forget to subscribe to see more from our Converted series!<br /><br />Like this video?
