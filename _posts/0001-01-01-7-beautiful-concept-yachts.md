There seems little reason then why design studio Tony Castro could not explore the material’s many applications, treatments, and finishes to create a yacht that brings its guests that one step closer to nature.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.superyachts.com/concept-yacht-1557/estrela-do-mar-specification.htm">https://www.superyachts.com/concept-yacht-1557/estrela-do-mar-specification.htm</a><br /><br />#3 Model: Frontier<br />Length Overall: 98.80m  (324'1&quot;ft)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.superyachts.com/concept-yacht-1449/frontier-specification.htm">https://www.superyachts.com/concept-yacht-1449/frontier-specification.htm</a><br /><br />#4 Model: TSY105<br />Length Overall: 105.00m  (344'5&quot;ft)<br />Based closely on the proven, super-efficient hull and diesel-electric engineering of the international award-winning M/Y White Rabbit, Echo Yachts, Sorgiovanni Designs, and One2three Naval Architects present their latest TSY105 105m trimaran superyacht concept.

Blending a rugged expedition-style profile with avant-garde use of glass, Stormbreaker is at home in any seas.
