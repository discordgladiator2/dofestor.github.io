People are more likely to believe and buy from someone they have seen 100 times than from a person they see for the first time.)<br /><br />-This video is used for teaching purposes.<br /><br />-I only used small pieces of the videos to get the point across where necessary.<br /><br />We make these videos to educate others in a motivational/inspirational form. We do not own the videos and music used in our videos. If any owners of the content clips would like us to remove their video, we will do so as soon as possible. Just contact us at buildempirenow@gmail.com .<br />_________<br /><br />How do you benefit from us using your video?<br /><br />- Your videos can change lives. We have had people messaging us that they have not commited suicide just because of our compilation â€“ Your Video. Imagine that you just saved a life because you picked the camera and started filming. We spread the message of your video and get it in front of the right audience.<br /><br />- We give credit to your channel â€“ New subscribers, more views and new people inside your ecosystem<br /><br />- It is scientificaly proven that people buy from people they see a lot. ItÂ´s about the personal brand. People like you are spending fortunes on advertisements. Our videos get hundreds of thousands views every month. You can sell stuff more easily because of the social proof we provide you.<br /><br />#buildempire #luxurylifestyle #billionairelifestyle<br /><br />Build Empire 2020{% endraw %}
