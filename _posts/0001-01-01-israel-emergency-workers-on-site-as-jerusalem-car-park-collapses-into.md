No injuries or casualties have been reported so far. An investigation into the causes of the collapse continues.<br /><br />#Sinkhole #Jerusalem #Israel<br /><br />    Video ID: 20210607-049<br /><br />    Video on Demand: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ruptly.tv/videos/20210607-049">https://ruptly.tv/videos/20210607-049</a><br />    Contact: cd@ruptly.tv    <br /><br />    Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Ruptly">http://twitter.com/Ruptly</a><br />    Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly">http://www.facebook.com/Ruptly</a>{% endraw %}
