Coming from India to China and then to Japan, the prayer was translated from the Sanskrit word ‘Saddharma-pundarikasutra » first into classical Chinese as ‘Miao-fa Lien-hua Ching’ and then into an ancient form of Japanese as ‘Myoho Renge Kyo’. <br /><br />The word 'Nam' derives from the Sanskrit ‘names’ and means ‘devotion’. It is placed before the name of all deities when worshipping them. <br /><br />‘Myo’ is the name given to the mystic nature of life and ‘Ho’ to its manifestation. <br /><br />‘Renge’ means lotus flower. The beautiful and undefiled Lotus blooms in a muddy swamp with all the obstacles against it. It symbolizes the emergence of our Buddha nature from the everyday problems and desires of ordinary life. ‘Renge’ stands also for the simultaneity of cause and effect, because the lotus puts forth its flower and seedpod at the same time.<br /><br />‘Kyo’ literally means sutra, the voice, and the teaching of the Buddha. <br />It also means sound rhythm or vibration and therefore it might be interpreted to indicate the practice of chanting. Since everything in the universe is connected through sound waves, ‘Kyo » refers to the life activity of universal phenomena and indicates that everything is a manifestation of the Mystic Law. <br /><br />‘Myoho-Renge-Kyo’ is the Mystic Law of the Lotus Sutra. An explanation can help you understand, but the Sutra can only be fully appreciated through chanting it. <br /><br />TINA: ‘However you must do it, to truly understand. When you say ‘Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo’  it will slowly remove all of the bad decisions you have ever made. The more you repeat the words the more you make your life clearer. The more you chant it the closer you get to your true nature. Your true nature is the right way of thinking and the right way of acting. The longer you go on this path, the more you avoid making wrong decisions. The Lotus Sutra helps me in my daily life. It is indeed mystical! And my life has proven this!’ <br /><br />GET 'BEYOND' (2009): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/uYccFZ">http://goo.gl/uYccFZ</a><br />GET 'CHILDREN BEYOND' (2011): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/vfrDek">http://goo.gl/vfrDek</a><br />GET &quot;BEYOND 'LOVE WITHIN' (2014): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/hiuNOG">http://goo.gl/hiuNOG</a><br /><br /><br />ALL RIGHT RESERVED BEYOND FOUNDATION<br /><br />‪#TinaTurnerBlog #TinaTurner #TinaTurnerMantras{% endraw %}
