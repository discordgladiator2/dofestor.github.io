{% raw %}Sir Lindsay Hoyle has hit out at Boris Johnson again for setting out his lockdown decision at a press conference instead of to MPs.<br /><br />The Commons Speaker told the Commons the Prime Minister 'should be here, I'm sorry if his dinner would have been affected' after Mr Johnson announced an extension of coronavirus measures to the media. <br /><br /><br />He accused the PM of 'running roughshod' over Parliament, and said Number 10's treatment of Parliament has been 'totally unacceptable' as he again stressed that announcements should first be made at the despatch box. <br /><br /><br />Sir Lindsay, who has raised similar concerns in the past, said he intends to demand a face-to-face meeting with the premier to tell him that the Commons 'matters' and must be taken 'seriously'.  <br /><br />Mr Johnson used a Downing Street press conference this evening to announce a four week delay to his lockdown exit roadmap, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock was then set to make a statement to MPs at around 8.30pm. <br /><br />But at the beginning of the evening session, the Speaker again blasted Mr Johnson and his government, telling the Commons: 'This is not how this house should be treated'.<br /><br />He added: 'The Government's own ministerial code says when Parliament is in session, the most important announcements of Government policy should be made in the first instance, in Parliament.<br /><br />'The Prime Minister polices the ministerial code, he wrote the foreword to it, he must now lead from the top, and follow the guidance in it.<br /><br />'This house can be assured that I will be pursuing this matter with him.<br /><br />'I do not find it acceptable at all that members of all this house are elected to come here to serve the constituents - not to serve them via Sky or BBC, the question should be made here, the Prime Minister should be here, I'm sorry if his dinner would have been affected.  <br /><br /><br />#BorisJohnson<br />#LindsayHoyle<br />#UnitedKingdom{% endraw %}
