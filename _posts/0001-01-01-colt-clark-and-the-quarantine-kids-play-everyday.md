{% raw %}Hey everyone! We hope you had a great Monday! We figured since Colt already had the glasses that we‚Äôd do a Buddy Holly song. üòä This is Colt Clark and the Quarantine Kids playing, ‚ÄúEveryday‚Äù by Buddy Holly.<br /><br />Our T-Shirts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theclarkfamilycreative.com/store">https://www.theclarkfamilycreative.com/store</a> <br />Instagram: www.instagram.com/theclarkfamilycreative/<br />Blog: www.theclarkfamilycreative.com<br /><br />If you've never seen one of our videos, feel free to read some info about us below. :)<br /><br />Hello everyone! We're the Clark family.  Colt (the Dad) is a professional musician and Aubree (me, the Mom behind the camera) is a photographer.  Together we home school our three children (even when we're not in the middle of a pandemic). :) We're keeping busy during our time at home by learning a new song every other day. We thought we'd record them and share as we go.  Hopefully it brightens your day! <br /><br />If you enjoy our videos, feel free to &quot;tip&quot; our virtual tip jar at<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/coltquarantinekids?locale.x=en_US">https://paypal.me/coltquarantinekids?locale.x=en_US</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/xy489p-virtual-tip-jar-for-colt-clark?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link-tip&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet">https://www.gofundme.com/f/xy489p-virtual-tip-jar-for-colt-clark?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link-tip&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet</a> <br />or if you prefer Venmo, @ColtClark{% endraw %}
