{% raw %}Just as it says on the tin. I needed to have these two together without a blip between and wanted to share with the class.<br /><br />Background art as taken from Shigenori Soejima. Link I used to get to it is: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://imgur.com/r84gJQr">http://imgur.com/r84gJQr</a><br /><br />Music composed by Shoji Meguro<br />I do not own nor claim to own the music in this video, but only to upload for personal use.<br /><br />Tracks 15 and 16 on the short OST and tracks 13 and 14 on the long OST.{% endraw %}
