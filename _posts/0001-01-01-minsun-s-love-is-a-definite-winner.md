{% raw %}APOLOGIES FOR THE Low quality of some clips as my moviemaker is not cooperating once again!<br /><br /><br /><br />A video that i put together of MinSun's winning moments at the KBS drama awards last new years eve...  <br /><br /><br /><br />Minho and Hyesun took home some awards and somehow you can just feel how happy and proud they are of the other and i mean not in a coworker kind of way... <br /><br /><br /><br />Several fancams also caught them unguarded sharing intimate moments in their own little world and i have included most of it in this video to spazz over... <br /><br /><br /><br />I thought the song is very fitting since it speaks of them achieving their dreams together and with each other and this awards night is a celebration not just of the deep friendship that they have formed while shooting BOF but also of the encouragement and support that they have given each other which made them win these awards in the end...<br /><br /><br /><br />0:06 - 0:14 - Minho at the red carpet<br /><br /><br /><br />0:15 - 0:21 - Hyesun arriving at the parking lot and stalked by reporters where she was referred to as Goo Junpyo's Geum Jandi<br /><br /><br /><br />0:22 - 0:27 - MinSun enjoying the shows opening together<br /><br /><br /><br />0:28 - 0:36 - A moment offstage where Minho turns back to check on Hyesun (his stares are just to die for...)<br /><br /><br /><br />0:37 - 0:50 - Minho's name being called out as the winner of the best newcomer award... Notice Hyesun's hand tenderly lingering on his back (which slid over to his elbow shown in other fancams) as a form of congratulations.<br /><br /><br /><br />0:50 - 1:05 - Minho's acceptance speech and Hyesun's proud and shy expression while he's onstage<br /><br /><br /><br />1:06 - 1:23 - Hyesun winning the netizens choice award and Minho being super proud of her (as if he's the one who won)....His expression just speaks of happiness and LOVE? hehehe!<br /><br /><br /><br />1:24 -1:39 - MinSun onstage for best couple... Hyesun asked by the host &quot;As Goo Hyesun and Geum Jandi who would she pick among the F4?&quot; which she answered with &quot;Lee Minho-shi&quot; shyly after a moments hesitation... Minho's face almost splitting into half over how widely he was grinning when he heard her answer... (Hyesun's been asked this question several times in the past and she always manages to give safe answers and not choose... this is the first time she specifically pointed out Minho)<br /><br /><br /><br />1:40 - 1:49 - Watching the AV presentation and sitting intimately close before the program started... Hyesun leaning on Minho's chest adn exchanging whispers while doing so which make them smile from time to time... What they're talking about? We wouldn't know... hehehe!<br /><br /><br /><br />1:51 - 2:02 - New Years countdown and Hyesun and Minho sharing a laugh when the clock struck 12... Notice how Hyesun intimately slaps Minho's thigh or arm whenever he laughs over something she says...<br /><br /><br /><br />2:02 - 2:19 - Hyesun's codi coming over to their table before the show and giving Minho candy or gum which he unwraps for Hyesun and takes care of the wrapper for her after... <br /><br /><br /><br />2:20 - 2:35 - MinSun moments caught onstage during couple awards<br /><br /><br /><br />2:36 -2:46 - Whispering intimately preshow and Hyesun resting her elbow against Minho's chest<br /><br /><br /><br />2:47 - 3:06 - Hyesun winning the best actress award and singling out Minho in her speech whom she said worked charmingly with her... Minho looks so happy when she thanked him...<br /><br /><br /><br />3:07 - 3:22 - Minho staring at Hyesun onstage and both of them still managing to share a private joke even onstage...<br /><br /><br /><br />3:23 - 3:36 - Show's over and Minho waits for Hyesun and helps her pack her things before leaving<br /><br /><br /><br />3:37 - 3:47 - Minho handing over the best couple trophy to Hyesun after the ceremony (they only got one... should she take care of it for them? hehehe!) ... Notice how Minho's bodyguard is ahead of Minho and Hyesun's codi with her as if they're leaving the venue together... :)<br /><br /><br /><br />wonder where they celebrated after?{% endraw %}
