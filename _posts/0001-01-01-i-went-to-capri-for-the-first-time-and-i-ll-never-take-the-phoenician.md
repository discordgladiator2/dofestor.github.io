{% raw %}I decided to celebrate my birthday in Capri this year, since I spent the last one in full lockdown, and it was so soooo necessary after months and months in the house (and in Rome). As much as I do enjoy living in Rome, I need a break every once in a while from the chaos, so I decided to make it a whole event and spend a few days on the island, to take it slow and not rush through seeing everything. It was well worth it, I enjoyed my stay and I'll definitely be back... in the low season when fewer tourists are on the island. This is just Part 1, so stay tuned for Part 2!<br /><br /><br />👩🏾‍🦱 ABOUT ME 👩🏾‍🦱<br />Ciao y'all! My name is Kenya, and I'm an American living in Rome, Italy sharing my experiences and travels while living abroad. After beginning my obsession with Italy at the young age of 9 years old and visiting for the first time during a study abroad/Erasmus vacation about 5 years ago, I hatched a plan that somehow... someway... I would make it to Italy, and here I am! <br /><br /><br />🏃🏾‍♀️FOLLOW ME 🏃🏾‍♀️<br />— INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/Naturally_Kenya">http://www.instagram.com/Naturally_Kenya</a><br />— FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/NaturallyKenya">http://www.facebook.com/NaturallyKenya</a><br />— TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/Naturally_Kenya">http://www.twitter.com/Naturally_Kenya</a> <br /><br /><br />▶️ SUBSCRIBE ▶️ <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/NaturallyKenyaNK">https://www.youtube.com/NaturallyKenyaNK</a><br /><br /><br />⭐️ Looking to reach me? ⭐️<br />NATURALLYKENYA@GMAIL.COM<br /><br />#expatsinitaly #capri #naturallykenya{% endraw %}
