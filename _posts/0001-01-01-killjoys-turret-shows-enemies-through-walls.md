{% raw %}So I've had this glitch several times now where Killjoys turret will actually start shooting at the enemy even when it can't see them. It's even happened to me in clutch situations where it was a 2v2 and we won simply because Killjoys turret showed where the enemies were through the wall. This definitely needs to be fixed as soon as possible so that the competitive aspect of Valorant isn't ruined by a bug.<br /><br />I've been using 200IQ Sage walls for so long that I know where and when to use them, I can occasionally even predict when the enemies will rotate back towards me and my Sage wall! This allows me to always get the drop on my enemies as they'll never expect a Sage to be waiting behind a rat wall even after the whole team has rotated to the other site! :D<br /><br />If you'd like to see more crazy walls and funny moments, check out my Twitch and other Socials, linked down below: <br /><br />S̲O̲C̲I̲A̲L̲S̲<br />TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/flowascending">https://www.twitch.tv/flowascending</a><br />DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/F32YgKsHd7">https://discord.com/invite/F32YgKsHd7</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FAscending">https://twitter.com/FAscending</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ivanormous/">https://www.instagram.com/ivanormous/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Killjoys Turret Shows ENEMIES Through WALLS<br /><br />#valorant #flowascending #sage #sagevalorant #killjoysturret #killjoy #200iq #bigbrainsagemain #200iqsagewalls #sagewall{% endraw %}
