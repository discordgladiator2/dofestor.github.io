{% raw %}Despite the wide variety of careers occupied by atmospheric scientists, most graduate students and postdocs have limited exposure to career options outside of universities. The goal of this webinar is to familiarize early career atmospheric scientists to research career opportunities in US national labs (e.g., NOAA, NASA, DOE, EPA) across the country and increase their knowledge of the unique responsibilities and work environments within the labs. The format of this event will be a panel discussion with 4-5 early and mid-career research scientists from various national labs. Panelists will be asked previously prepared questions about their day-to-day experiences and responsibilities. If time permits, the audience may be allowed to submit live questions as well.{% endraw %}
