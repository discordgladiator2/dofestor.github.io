The vehicle was designed to counter Soviet heavy tanks at long range (up to 1,829 m) and should have been able to withstand return fire from 122 mm guns at a distance of up to 500 m. After the development of 193 mm Malkara anti-tank rockets—which were a cheaper and more efficient choice for countering the IS-series tanks—the vehicle lost its relevance. The project was canceled shortly after a dummy vehicle was built.<br /><br />Assault tank based on the Conqueror chassis with a 183mm gun mounted on it. The project was cancelled in the 1950s and it never saw military service.<br /><br />Known as the &quot;(The Second) Death Star&quot;, this tank destroyer is well-known for its apocalyptic gun. Especially when loaded with premium shells, this monster is a death sentence to any tank and you must avoid frontal combat with this tank at all costs unless it's reloading.<br /><br />As a downside, the FV215b (183) can only turn its turret 45 degrees either direction. The gun has a horrific load time and low ammo capacity, comparable to SPGs, and is not very accurate. So as long as you can outmaneuver its gun range you will be able to destroy it.<br /><br />The FV215b (183) was replaced by the FV217 Badger turretless tank destroyer and became a special vehicle for those who had it before the replacement.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Outro song: OST World of Tanks – Intro Login 2018<br /><br /><br /><br />Mod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wgmods.net/21/details">https://wgmods.net/21/details</a>{% endraw %}
