{% raw %}DYSON SPHERE PROGRAM<br />Build the most efficient intergalactic factory in space simulation strategy<br />game Dyson Sphere Program! Harness the power of stars, collect resources, plan and design production lines and develop your interstellar factory from a small space workshop to a galaxy-wide industrial empire<br />Combining Factorio and Satisfactory on a Galactic scale!<br /><br />ABOUT THE GAME<br />Dyson Sphere Program is a sci-fi simulation game with space, adventure,<br />exploration and factory automation elements where you have to build your<br />own galactic industrial empire from scratch<br />In the distant future, the power of science and technology has ushered a new age to the human race. Space and time have become irrelevant thanks<br />to virtual reality. A new kind of supercomputer has been developed – a machine which superior artificial intelligence and computing capability will<br />push humanity even further. There is only one problem: there isn’t enough<br />energy in the whole planet to feed this machine.<br />You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing a Dyson<br />Sphere, a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its<br />power and energy. Only a few decades ago it was considered a hypothetical, impossible invention – but now it’s in your hands… if you can manage to develop this space workshop in some galactic backwater into a galaxy-wide industrial production empire!<br /><br />ABOUT EARLY ACCESS<br />While the core mechanics of Dyson Sphere Program are ready, the game still can grow and evolve a lot – and Early Access is just the perfect place for it to reach its true potential. We believe that by letting players experience the main content of Dyson Sphere Program and actively interacting with them to collect their feedback will allow us to improve the game and make it much better than it would be without this Early Access stage. Our plans are for this EA stage to be about 1 year long. But that is not written in stone<br /><br />KEY FEATURES<br />◇ Build a galactic industrial empire from scratch: start with a small workshop and improve it until it spans the whole galaxy<br />◇ Develop your very own Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that orbits<br />around a star harnessing all its power and energy, from the first screw<br />to its completion<br />◇ Explore a vast universe procedurally generated with all kinds of celestial bodies: neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants…<br />◇ Gather resources in planets of all types: ocean, lava, desert, frozen,<br />gaseous planets…<br />◇ Research new technologies to improve your factories… and discover<br />the secrets of the universe<br />◇ Build mechas to fly, sail or jump through outer space and alien planets<br />◇ Transport materials across the galaxy to your facilities: thousands of<br />transport ships will flow endlessly to your factories and back!<br />◇ Design the most efficient automated factory and production line<br />◇ Customize your factory and Dyson Sphere to make it unique<br />◇ Design a balanced power network, producing energy in all kinds of<br />power plants like wind turbines, artificial stars… through conveyor<br />belts, and you’ve got technology to help your buildings fit the grid automatically during the construction process. You’ve got the best tools<br />COSMO can afford to build a massive-scale automated production line<br /><br />SCHEDULE:<br />YouTube: Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday at 16:00 CEST<br />Livestreams: Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 20:00 CEST<br /><br />SOCIAL:<br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/nilaus">https://www.twitch.tv/nilaus</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Nilaus">https://www.patreon.com/Nilaus</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://discord.gg/nilaus">http://discord.gg/nilaus</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChristianNilaus">https://twitter.com/ChristianNilaus</a><br />Tips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/nilaus">https://streamlabs.com/nilaus</a><br />Merchandise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/nilaus1#/merch">https://streamlabs.com/nilaus1#/merch</a><br />YouTube VOD Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkJ74yQGOXyZ6Prg6obg4w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkJ74yQGOXyZ6Prg6obg4w</a><br /><br />RESOURCES:<br />Seed: 97858565<br />VODs of Twitch Livestreams: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkJ74yQGOXyZ6Prg6obg4w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkJ74yQGOXyZ6Prg6obg4w</a><br /><br />#DysonSphere #Factorio #LetsPlay{% endraw %}
