{% raw %}Old, ABANDONED Farm House| Metal Detecting | PlugMaster Ford | ANFIBIO<br /><br />JOIN ME Monday night, June 7th at 7pm Central on the channel RobFindsTreasure, where I will be the LIVESTREAM special guest with Rob and Ravenhawk Coins.  Here is a link to Rob's channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxD98GXG8opPMHA6-JJSyJg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxD98GXG8opPMHA6-JJSyJg</a><br /><br />Today's episode is a combination of a couple hunts this year.  As you can imagine with all that has gone on with Mikey this year, we have had limited time to hit the treasure hunting road.  Things are starting to settle in a bit more and hopefully we can continue to pump out the videos.  I sure hope you LIKE and SUBCRIBE so you don't miss an upcoming episode!{% endraw %}
