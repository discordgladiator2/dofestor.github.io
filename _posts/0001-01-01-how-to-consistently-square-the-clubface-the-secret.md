{% raw %}In this tip, I teach you how to consistently square the clubface at impact with both irons and driver.  This really is the secret to playing consistently golf so make sure you watch the whole video.<br /><br />Please visit the link below and I will send you free samples from my Body Swing book and video series:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bodyswing.com/freesamples/">https://bodyswing.com/freesamples/</a><br /><br />Hitting straight irons and drives makes the game so much more fun.  I figured out how to square the club face a long time ago.  Before that, I literally hit the ball everywhere.  So if you're someone who's not consistent with both irons and driver then you really need to learn this secret.<br /><br />In no way am I going to tell you to hit down on the ball, make the shaft lean forward, square the face manually at impact or anything else.  So forget what you have heard in the past.  This really is the secret to squaring the clubface at impact.    <br /><br />Please visit the link below and I will send you free samples from my Body Swing book and video series:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bodyswing.com/freesamples/">https://bodyswing.com/freesamples/</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br />My Websites<br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ignitiongolf.com">https://ignitiongolf.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paulwilsongolf.com">https://paulwilsongolf.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bodyswing.com">https://bodyswing.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://swingmachinegolf.com">https://swingmachinegolf.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://howtohitdriver.com">http://howtohitdriver.com</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br />My App<br />-------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Work with me live from anywhere in the world through my new app called COACHLINK.<br />Available for both Apple and Android devices.
