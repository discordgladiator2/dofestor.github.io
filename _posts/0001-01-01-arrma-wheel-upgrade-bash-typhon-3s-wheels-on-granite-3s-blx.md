{% raw %}ARRMA WHEEL UPGRADE:  In this video, I will be upgrading our Granite wheels. I will be jumping and bashing Typhon 3S wheels and tires I’ve installed on my Arrma Granite 3S rc monster truck.  In order to install these wheels, you must also install the axles and 17mm hexes from the Arrma Typhon as well.  These tires performed great. It’s a nice mix of 2 great rc’s.  One department lacking is the ability to do backflips since these tires lack the mass the Granite tires have. Enjoy the video!
