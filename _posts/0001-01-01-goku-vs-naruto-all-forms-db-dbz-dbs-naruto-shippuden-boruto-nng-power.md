{% raw %}[Goku VS Naruto]<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video I did not include a Hypothetical for Goku because I really don't know what else he could have as a new transformation after the ultra instinct completely mastered in front of Moro, for Naruto it is is true that the Baryon Mode should be his last transformation.<br /><br /><br />But he could not. Kurama did say that Baryon Mode is totally different from Naruto's So6p, Naruto could very well try to combine Baryon Mode with Sage of Six Paths with his 2 powers combined he could not die from Baryon Mode. this is only my opinion, tell me what do you think ?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching my video and if you liked the video subscribe.<br /><br />Follow me too on my instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/calefla.xi72/?hl=fr">https://www.instagram.com/calefla.xi72/?hl=fr</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------<br />Disclaimer: it's non-profit and the songs are credited.&quot; or &quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. <br /><br />Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. <br /><br /><br />Non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favor of fair use.
