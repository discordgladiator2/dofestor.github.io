{% raw %}This week‚Äôs video is about the idea of freedom, settling down, and familial responsibilities. My story is deeply influenced by norms in Hispanic culture, and I wanted to share my experiences with you, as well as my current lifestyle situation and goals.<br />I will share these words with you, told to me long ago by a good friend:<br />‚ÄúPeople who chose to stay in one place, to be caregivers, to take less risks, to work steady jobs that can always put meals on the table‚Ä¶ those people are not only strong but expressions of love and - I believe - should be celebrated no less than those who chose to live differently. Whatever yours is, each of us has a story worth sharing.‚Äù  READ MORE BELOW ‚¨áÔ∏è <br /><br />ü¶äüçÑMy Etsy Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart">https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart</a><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è No obligation whatsoever, but if you would like to donate to support this channel. $5 will get a thank you postcard (my own art) from me in the mail (you must include address in your note so I can send it!).

They inspire me, and in some ways, I like to try to live differently to some mainstream trends. Something that comes to mind is that I don‚Äôt like over consumption and am personally very concerned about the environment. <br /><br />Many of these extraordinary people have unusual jobs, pursue their passions, are very self reliant, free of certain common commitments, world travelers, can fund their lifestyle, etc. These people are celebrated, as they should be! They are amazing and interesting and their story - like everyone‚Äôs story - is worth sharing. <br /><br />But in light of this, I wanted to take a moment and highlight those who have never had those opportunities, people who chose or had to give up so much for others:<br />their children, parents, community. My mother pushed aside certain dreams for me, my incredible grandma/Abuela worked long crushing weeks to raise a family that was fed and clothed, committed to stopping the cycles of abuse that had existed in her family for generations. I grew up on military bases, sometimes in places that received foreign refugees: I know of many who have literally given their lives for their children, or worked as slaves for decades simply to allow them the opportunity for an education. On a less drastic note, there are so many people like me choosing to establish themselves in a place where they can best serve their loved ones and community.<br /><br />Of course, I am not encouraging people not to pursue their dreams and instead adhere to a burdensome sense of obligation, or stay in a toxic situation. I hope that is obvious. I am working towards my dreams myself. But I am recognizing that even the ability to pursue those dreams is an incredible gift. And that people who chose to stay in one place, to be caregivers, to take less risks, to work steady jobs that can always put meals on the table, those people are equally strong and brave and - I believe - should be celebrated no less. That is why I wished to dedicate a video to it.{% endraw %}
