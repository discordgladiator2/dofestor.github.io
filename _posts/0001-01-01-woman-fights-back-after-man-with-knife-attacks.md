{% raw %}A California woman would not back down as a knife-wielding man went after her family's money. The footage recorded Saturday afternoon shows Concepcion Escalante, 23, working alone at her family's car insurance business. A man walks in, and the conversation between him and Escalante is cordial. &quot;He was so nice, smiling,&quot; she told Inside Edition. Then the suspect said he had to go back to his car and retrieve his license. Thirty minutes later, he returns with a knife in his hand.{% endraw %}
