It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of May 2019,# jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites<br /><br />What is jQuery and why it is used?<br />jQuery is a lightweight, &quot;write less, do more&quot;, JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.<br /><br />What is difference between JavaScript and jQuery?<br />The main difference among the three is that JavaScript is client-side, i.e., in the browser scripting language, whereas jQuery is a library (or framework) built with JavaScript. Meanwhile, AJAX is a method to immediately update parts of the UI without reloading the web pages<br /><br />Is jQuery still relevant?<br />The short answer: yes. Yes, of course it's worth learning jQuery. The internet is littered with tutorials and knowledge across your peers is vast - that's to say: help is in abundance.
