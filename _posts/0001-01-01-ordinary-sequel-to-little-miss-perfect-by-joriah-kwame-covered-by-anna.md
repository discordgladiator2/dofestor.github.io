{% raw %}Hello everyone! This week I sang Ordinary (the sequel to Little Miss Perfect) by Joriah Kwame (but is also super popular in The Owl House fandom)!<br /><br />This is such a cute song and felt like the perfect upload seeing as Owl House season 2 starts this weekend! <br /><br />As always, thank you for your continued support! It really does mean the world to me.
