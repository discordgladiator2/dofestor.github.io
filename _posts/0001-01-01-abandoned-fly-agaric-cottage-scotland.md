{% raw %}Exploring a rare abandoned cottage in Scotland, this one has been on my list for a long time and thanks to Mark for tracking it down, so it was time for the long drive to the location for such a short explore, it was worth it though, we did wait for 2 hours in the car as our mates behind us had broken down and none of us could contact them due to the lack of reception on our phones, <br />so eventually we had to do the explore without them only they had shown up at the end, glad they made it though<br /><br />RAW Footage in Scotland{% endraw %}
