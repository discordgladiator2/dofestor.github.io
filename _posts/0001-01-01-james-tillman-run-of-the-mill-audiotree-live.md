He prefers the soft tones of an electric guitar; writing chunky grooves on flat-wound strings. Tillman swoons in a sweet falsetto over jazzy barre chords he slides along the neck. He finished up a solo tour opening for tUnE-yArDs in 2014, making his presence known to the largest audiences of his young career.<br /><br />Recorded on February 2, 2015 in Chicago, IL.<br /><br />Visit the band's website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jmtill.bandcamp.com/">https://jmtill.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br />--<br /><br />Youtube Playlist -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1UdLELe">http://bit.ly/1UdLELe</a><br />Subscribe to Audiotree -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1LLy4ur">http://bit.ly/1LLy4ur</a><br />Watch more -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.audiotree.tv/">http://www.audiotree.tv/</a>{% endraw %}
