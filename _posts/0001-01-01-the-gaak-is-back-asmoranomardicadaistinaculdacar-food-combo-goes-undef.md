{% raw %}Modern Horizons 2 continues to be insane as I SWEEP a Magic the Gathering Online Modern league with Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar Food Combo! This deck plays the namesake chef and their Underworld Cookbook to power out ridiculous turns with Feasting Troll King and make giant constructs with Urza's Saga. The Cauldron Familiar + Witch's Oven interaction has never looked so good. Dinner's ready, come get some!<br /><br />Decklist:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4056508#paper">https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/4056508#paper</a><br /><br />Try this deck yourself with the Cardhoarder loan program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cardhoarder.com/">https://www.cardhoarder.com/</a><br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:35 Deck Tech<br />4:55 Round 1<br />36:13 Round 2<br />38:05 Round 3<br />56:55 Round 4<br />1:17:24 Round 5<br />1:34:33 Final Thoughts<br /><br />Business inquiries: boshnrollstream@gmail.com<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/BoshNRoll">https://www.patreon.com/BoshNRoll</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/BoshNRoll">https://www.twitter.com/BoshNRoll</a><br />Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.TheEternalGloryPodcast.com">https://www.TheEternalGloryPodcast.com</a><br /><br />Want me to try YOUR favorite deck?
