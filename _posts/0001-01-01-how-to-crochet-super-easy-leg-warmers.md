{% raw %}NOTE:  the hook size I used in this pattern is a 5.5mm (I forgot to mention that in the tutorial)<br />This video will take you step by step through the pattern for these super easy leg warmers, a great pattern for beginners!  This particular pattern is for kids size (aprox age 5-7) but can be altered for other sizes.
